Now in its 10  year, the Symposium marks the completion of an intensive summer research program\n                     that allows students to apply their studies toward sponsored projects under the guidance\n                     of Kennesaw State faculty scholars. \u201cToday is a celebration of many things,\u201d said Vishnu Suppiramaniam, interim dean of the  . \u201cFirst, we recognize our students and their work throughout the summer, and second, we celebrate the continued partnership between Birla Carbon and Kennesaw State University that is highlighted by the Birla Carbon Scholars Program. Through this unique collaborative effort, we have seen our students investigate truly impactful topics that only serve to benefit their growth as researchers.\u201d Working in Suppiramaniam's laboratory, Moerschel theorized the use of tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as THC, among pregnant people led to memory and learning issues in children via specific receptors in the brain. By exposing rats to THC and then putting them through mazes and other learning experiments, Moerschel discovered that the drug affected the rats\u2019 learning. She added that little research on prenatal THC exposure exists and that it\u2019s a field ripe for discovery. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to create some groundbreaking research on THC because currently there\u2019s only research on how cocaine affects those specific receptors,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to educate the public on how ingesting marijuana during pregnancy can affect children and lead to the rising autism rates we see today.\u201d In the spring, the College of Science and Mathematics (CSM) selected 12 students to each receive a $4,000 stipend to pursue research during a summer program established by Birla Carbon, a worldwide chemical manufacturer.\u00a0 The 12 scholars were chosen based on the recommendations of faculty members, submission\n                     of an undergraduate research project abstract, and a GPA of 3.0 or higher. Recipients\n                     worked with their sponsoring faculty members on their proposed research projects in\n                     six departments within CSM. This year\u2019s scholars, their majors and faculty mentors included: Since 2014, funds provided by Birla Carbon have enabled 93 Birla Carbon Scholars to\n                     participate in research. This year marks the 10th cohort of scholars, and Birla Carbon\n                     recently reaffirmed its pledge to the program by extending the agreement for another\n                     five years and adding $325,000 to the commitment. Birla Carbon CEO John Loudermilk\n                     said the company looks forward to the continued partnership as well as the Symposium,\n                     a yearly event to showcase young scientists. \u201cAfter many years, the partnership between Birla Carbon and Kennesaw State University remains successful and has reached an unprecedented maturity level,\u201d Loudermilk said. \u201cOur Birla Scholars Program is one example, as many students from the College of Science and Mathematics apply each summer. To see the popularity and support from all is fulfilling in every sense.\u201d Along with the $4,000 stipend each scholar received, Moerschel received an additional $2,000 in travel funds to present her research at a national or regional conference.\u00a0 Kennesaw State biology professor will create research opportunities through NIH grant Kennesaw State graduate's national security and data analysis interests lead to defense job Kennesaw State and Cobb County partnership pioneers new mental health 911 response  Kennesaw State student finds direction in chemistry with Double-Owl program A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its more than 43,000 students.

After a 10-month, $7.4 million renovation, all the fitness equipment is gleaming,\n                     the facility is waiting to be explored, and the joy was apparent on all those at the\n                     reopening ceremony on Tuesday, including Kennesaw State President Kathy Schwaig. \u201cWhen we have beautiful places to go, it elevates the experience for all of us,\u201d said Schwaig. \u201cI love the color, the excitement, and the feel of this space. When students can connect with each other, it\u2019s powerful. This provides that. This is a beautiful facility and very exciting day to reopen it.\u201d The Marietta rec center has been around for more than 20 years, but it officially\n                     shut its doors in October 2022 for a refresh. Immediate tasks included installing\n                     a new heating-cooling and ventilation system and some electrical upgrades. After that,\n                     through multiple focus groups, students provided ideas of what they wanted in the\n                     fitness center. Executive Director for Sports and Recreation Tara Parker said students\u2019 top wish was more space for weights and conditioning, as well as more group fitness classes and some outdoor adventure activities. The project also included bringing in new fitness equipment, treadmills, ellipticals,\n                     free weights, weight machines, plus updating the area known as the Strength Arcade\n                     to allow more Olympic-style lifting for students. There is also a new turf-covered\n                     area where students can pull a sled or flip tires, which is unique to the Marietta\n                     rec center compared to the Kennesaw Campus rec center. Assistant Director for Marketing and Member Services Brittany Booth said streaming\n                     services have been added so students can attend a group fitness class in person or\n                     participate from home. \u201cOur mission was to create engagement and opportunities for students to learn lifelong healthy habits they can take beyond their college career, as well as build an affinity for Kennesaw State,\u201d Booth said. During the renovation, the Health Clinic was relocated, and the space it formerly\n                     held in the rec center is now a lounging area for students. \u201cIt\u2019s an area where students can come and study,\u201d said Parker. \u201cOr maybe they can meet up with their group before a workout, or if they want a place to hang out with their friends after a workout, they have it.\u201d While the Marietta rec center is open, the total renovation isn\u2019t complete. There are still plans to add a climbing gym as well as replace the basketball floor surface, update the goals in the two-court gym, and add a pickleball court, badminton lines, and a walking track around the courts. \u201cThese are all things students have been asking for,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWe are excited to see that come to fruition.\u201d Booth said she is confident students will like the changes in the renovated rec center. \u201cI hope students feel like they have this place to go to get away from it all \u2014 class, studying, all the homework \u2013 and make themselves and their well-being a priority,\u201d she said.

As Kennesaw State\u2019s football team moves from one conference and classification to another and makes changes for the future, Marching Owls director Brandon Meeks plans to do the same for KSU\u2019s marching band. \u201cThe Marching Owls are at a pivotal point in the history of the program,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cWe're starting the ninth season this year, and we're in a culture of transition, and it's perfect because football is doing the same thing right now. We're all transitioning for a year, and we'll all be ready next year when we move into a new conference.\u201d The Marching Owls have an all-time high 280 musicians representing every major on campus. In his second year as director, Meeks said he wants to enhance the program to ensure optimal crowd engagement. That starts with the early moments of game day\u2014and the band\u2019s march from its facility on Busbee Drive to the stadium. \u201cOur parade to the stadium will be more of a performance than just an event,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop and play at different tailgating spots along the way. We\u2019ll go into the stadium later than we usually do, because when you see the band coming into the stadium, we want you to know it\u2019s game time. We\u2019re ready, and our students are ready.\u201d \n                      Once inside the stadium, the band will play \u201cGeorgia on My Mind,\u201d which moves from its traditional spot between the third and fourth quarters. Meeks said alumni and students love the song enough to want to hear it at games, but that it belonged in another moment. After that, they\u2019ll play \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and then take their seats behind the visitors\u2019 bench, another opportunity to make their presence felt. He said the band will experiment with various short songs relevant to the game action\u2014if it works, they\u2019ll keep it in the program. If not, they\u2019ll try something else in another game. \u201cWe have to unrelentingly support our football team,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to create a true home field advantage and that means being loud and proud.\u201d Beyond that, Meeks said KSU football fans would have to attend the games to see what the Marching Owls have in store. He did offer the hint that the Marching Owls seek to build momentum as KSU joins Conference USA starting with the 2024-25 academic year. The men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s appearance in the 2023 NCAA Tournament started that momentum of crowd engagement, as the strains of the Owls\u2019 war chant (\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go to war/With the Owls, with the Owls\u201d) still ring in thousands of ears. \u201cThe nice thing about Kennesaw State is we have an opportunity here to establish some traditions,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cThe Marching Owls are here to be a symbol for KSU, and we want to engage the crowd and create a truly amazing game day experience.\u201d Record Kennesaw State football crowd reflects student-engagement success Renovated Kennesaw State Marietta Campus rec center reopens Fun programs have serious purpose to engage Kennesaw State students Kennesaw State leaders welcome faculty and staff for new academic year A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its more than 43,000 students.

Students receive an email each fall inviting them to activate their\n                        official KSU Merit page. Kennesaw State automatically updates students\u2019 Merit pages with accomplishments such as making dean\u2019s or president\u2019s lists, earning scholarships, presenting research at a conference, studying abroad, or participating in student competition teams. In addition, students can customize their profile pages with pictures, work and school experience, and awards earned. To learn more about Merit Pages and to see published stories, visit  . Following are answers to some frequently asked questions about the platform: How do Merit Pages benefit students? Merit creates a personal record of each student\u2019s academic career, showcasing achievements and activities. A Merit page also is useful for seeking a job, with options to upload a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and list employment history. Hundreds of colleges around the country use Merit Pages to recognize and promote student success, so Owls who opt in will join a national network of college students. Also, Merit updates are shared with students\u2019 high schools, hometown news outlets and state legislators. Merit pages can be connected to social networks such as Twitter, Instagram or LinkedIn,\n                                          ensuring that friends and family are able to see and learn about the great activities\n                                          students are participating in and being recognized for at Kennesaw State. How does Merit work? Merit is an automated email system managed by KSU Strategic Communications and Marketing.\n                                          When students earn recognition, the University publishes a personalized article to\n                                          Merit and sends it to the hometown newspapers, high schools and government officials\n                                          of each student involved. Each time new content is added to their Merit page, students receive an e-mail with a link to view their story and share their achievements with friends and family. Parents also receive an email allowing them to share their students\u2019 accomplishments on their own social media channels. How do students update or customize their Merit pages? How is students\u2019 privacy protected? Kennesaw State respects students\u2019 privacy. The content KSU shares through Merit includes only information about students that is designated as \u201cdirectory information\" under the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Student pages are set by default to be private and are not searchable on kennesaw.meritpages.com, unless students adjust their profile settings to make their pages searchable. However, stories containing students\u2019 first and last names automatically will be shared with hometown news outlets, high schools and state legislators. How can students opt out? Opting out removes a student\u2019s profile from Merit Pages and prevents the University from publishing future achievements by that student. Students can opt out at any time by following  .

This is where she decompresses from life as a dual bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s student studying  .\n                      \n                   In combining her love of the environment and her love for chemistry, she helps create\n                     conjugated polymers from which organic electronics can be made, and that can be degraded\n                     when their usefulness has passed. That excites Charland-Martin, who said she feels\n                     she is doing something to reduce pollution and help the environment. \u201cThe idea that our polymers can be processed into thin films for flexible screens, that's incredible. But I think the part that I enjoy the most is the sustainability aspect,\u201d she said. \u201cPlastic pollution is a big issue, and I'm actively trying to make it so that they can be degradable. That\u2019s exciting to me.\u201d Through KSU\u2019s   program, Charland-Martin is now on a fast track to both bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in chemistry, and to continue this impactful research. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of extra work, but I love what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Charland-Martin said. \u201cThe Double-Owl will put me in a good spot for a career in chemistry, which is a program I wasn\u2019t aware of before I came to KSU.\u201d The Double-Owl program affords undergraduates the opportunity to take up to nine credit hours toward a master\u2019s degree while still an undergraduate, which saves money and time for a student. Charland-Martin carries a full load of undergraduate courses and has started on her master\u2019s studies with a couple of graduate classes, including polymer chemistry and research skills and ethics, in Fall 2022. Instead of four years for a bachelor\u2019s plus two years of graduate school for a master\u2019s, she\u2019ll finish both in five years. Her journey started in Spring 2022 with research in the polymer chemistry laboratory of assistant professor Graham Collier, who suggested she apply for the Birla Carbon Scholars program that offers a stipend for 10 weeks of research in the summer. One of 11 scholars, she won the top prize at the annual symposium in August 2022. As she gained experience in the lab and a love for the science, she learned about the prospects for a scientist with a master\u2019s in chemistry. \u201cDr. Collier suggested that I look into the Double-Owl program and build my research project into a master\u2019s thesis,\u201d said Charland-Martin, also a   student. \u201cKnowing how a master\u2019s degree in chemistry can help me in my career, I decided to go for it.\u201d Charland-Martin arrived at Kennesaw State in Fall 2020 and said that she chose KSU for its proximity to home and her part-time job, as well as its affordability. After her Birla Carbon Scholars project in Summer 2022, Collier hired her as a paid research assistant through his grant from the National Science Foundation. He said Charland-Martin\u2019s love of chemistry and passion for research come through in her presence as a leader in the lab. \u201cAriane brings an infectious enthusiasm to her project and the lab culture,\u201d he said. \u201cSince she joined the research group, she quickly ascended to a leadership position and has really helped grow the group\u2019s expertise in a new direction. Overall, she is an exemplary student and a great ambassador for the Double-Owl program.\u201d This article was originally published in the   of Kennesaw State University Magazine.

Contained within the structure of that frame are excellent classroom instruction;\n                     support services to help students thrive in and outside the classroom and laboratory;\n                     opportunities for students to become involved in the campus community; enriching experiences,\n                     including athletics and arts; to be a part of impactful research and more. All help\n                     students succeed in their KSU journeys and earn the degrees they have chosen to work\n                     toward, Schwaig said. \u201cEvery single one of our over 44,000 students is important. You are important. And what you do matters,\u201d Schwaig said. \u201cThank you for being a part of the structure. A part of the frame that makes this place a powerful force. A beautiful piece of art in our world today.\u201d Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Ivan Pulinkala opened the program\n                     and recognized new faculty and staff who were joining KSU for their first Fall semester.\n                     He also thanked those faculty leaders who worked on updating academic guidelines across\n                     the University. \u201cAs the 2023-24 academic year progresses, let\u2019s work collaboratively, respectfully and thoughtfully to celebrate and advance every part of our institutional ecosystem, as our success in the year ahead will greatly benefit from an integrated approach to our institution\u2019s advancement,\u201d Pulinkala said. Vice President for Student Affairs Eric Arneson spoke about the ways his division\n                     supports the success of KSU students, including the FLIGHT: First-Year Connections\n                     program. FLIGHT focuses on creating a sense of unity among incoming first-year students\n                     through group activities and more. \u201cResearch over time has clearly demonstrated that students who are engaged with their university tend to have higher retention and graduation rates than those who are not involved,\u201d Arneson said. Director of Athletics Milton Overton thanked faculty and staff for their support of Kennesaw State\u2019s student athletes and athletic programs. The sense of community on campus helps athletes thrive academically as well as athletically, he said. \u201cSomehow you all make a large campus feel like a small, friendly community, according to our parents, our athletes and our recruits,\u201d Overton said. The Fall semester begins Sunday for most new students with the annual First-Year Convocation\n                     gathering, followed by the Splashbash event featuring water slides and other games\n                     on the Campus Green. Fall classes for all new and returning students begin on Monday with Schwaig passing\n                     out pieces of the traditional First Day of School Cake on both the Kennesaw and Marietta\n                     campuses. Weeks of Welcome also begin Monday, which includes events to let students\n                     know about opportunities to get involved in University activities and campus services\n                     to help them succeed inside the classroom and out.

Lines formed for the waterslide and rides on an inflatable shark, while a football\n                     and multiple frisbees flew nearby. It was just what 8,000 new students needed to kick\n                     off their college careers. \u201cSchool starts tomorrow so having all these activities makes us feel more welcome and at home,\u201d Cabrera said. \u201cWhoever came up with this idea definitely knew what they were doing.\u201d Cabrera\u2019s words reflect the purpose behind events like SplashBash, which followed First-Year Convocation and preceded the annual First Day of School Cake events on Monday. Getting and keeping students engaged in the campus community through activities improves their chances of success inside and outside the classroom. The freshman class this year includes the second cohort of the  , which began in 2022 as a way of building a community of students throughout their time at KSU. The FLIGHT27 students \u2013 named by their year of potential graduation \u2013 began their collective journey during orientation sessions this summer and will have opportunities during the next four years to come together in special events on campus. \n                      Early in her tenure as Kennesaw State president, Kathy Schwaig emphasized building campus community and culture as one of the pillars of the University\u2019s approach to education. From that foundation came strategies to build a culture of support for students. \u201cAt KSU, we all have the opportunity to be a part of the process of helping students shape and build their lives,\u201d Schwaig said. \u201cWe must be sure we have an integrated student success network that helps us address student progression as well as student experience. We must be more deliberate in our work to engage and support students and ensure that they are on a path to graduate in four years.\u201d KSU\u2019s Division of Student Affairs launched the FLIGHT program as an effort to nurture a community of incoming freshmen by providing a system of connection and support at the beginning and lasting throughout their college experience. \u201cThis is a long-term strategy to create an identity where every student in that class knows they\u2019re part of a team, of a family,\u201d said Eric Arneson, vice president of student affairs. \u201cOur university is committed to student retention and graduation, and we know that students who are engaged with their school tend to stay; students who are not, too often fade away.\u201d \n                      The program brings several units on campus together \u2013 orientation, student leadership, Counseling and Psychological Services, and Residence Life and Housing \u2013 to ensure that students can connect with the resources they need. The inaugural FLIGHT cohort included more than 8,000 students who had multiple opportunities to engage with the University during the first year. New students this year received a special FLIGHT27 jersey during orientation. Each FLIGHT cohort has a class dean \u2013 this year\u2019s FLIGHT27 dean is Ronald Briggs, associate vice president of student affairs and dean of students \u2013 to help keep the group connected to resources they need. Members of FLIGHT26, KSU\u2019s first class under the initiative, said they enjoy their connections to their classmates. Psychology major Grace Soto benefited from communications from Student Affairs that\n                     helped her connect with activities that interested her. She joined KSU Brand Ambassadors,\n                     a group of students who promote the University. She also got involved with undergraduate\n                     research in psychology, as well as with a campus ministry. \u201cThe home that I created in the 10 months that I lived on campus, every little experience that I had, whether it was with FLIGHT26 or it was through Kennesaw State, or even the people that I met, made my first year a positive and welcoming experience,\u201d Soto said. Sunday\u2019s events were the first opportunities for FLIGHT27 to gather as a class.\u00a0 At First-Year Convocation, students were welcomed by Schwaig, Provost Ivan Pulinkala, Arneson, Briggs and all of the University\u2019s deans. They heard from students like Student Government Association president Zae Brewer and senior media and entertainment major Gabrielle Jones about their experiences. They learned the school fight song and met Owls head football coach Brian Bohannon. \n                      Freshman Alexa Owen of Cumming, Georgia, said she liked hearing from fellow students about what\u2019s possible for those who immerse themselves in college life. \u201cThere\u2019s so much happening,\u201d she said. \u201cAll this stuff to get us to know other people is great, and I just started talking to a couple of people outside the Convocation Center. So we exchanged phone numbers and made plans to hang out later this week.\u201d Another tradition to foster community among all students happened on the first day of classes on Monday. Hundreds thronged the Campus Green in Kennesaw and the student center on the Marietta Campus for their turn to stuff a plush owl and grab a slice of KSU\u2019s traditional First Day of School Cake. Jennifer Ordonez, a new graduate student in electrical and computer engineering, stopped\n                     in the student center to visit the bookstore, but heard about the cake and the Stuff-an-Owl\n                     event and joined the festivities. \u201cWe found out about the cake and the owls, and it\u2019s so nice,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat a welcome for everybody, especially for those of us who might not be used to the environment or the campus. I just moved from Wisconsin, so everything is new.\u201d In Kennesaw, first-year students Makayla Culpepper and Arianna O\u2019Neal enjoyed relief from the August heat in the shade and said they had enjoyed exploring campus and attended community building events since moving in last week. \u201cI went to SplashBash\n                      , convocation and the Silent Disco in the Austin Residence Complex,\u201d said Culpepper, a criminal justice major from Savannah. \u201cWith our class being so big \u2014 over 8,000 people \u2014 it can be a little scary to meet people.\u201d She added that her resident advisors and others have encouraged her to get out and\n                     try to meet people. Since taking that advice, Culpepper said she has found everyone\n                     kind and inviting, made friends and built confidence. Across the Campus Green, senior public health education major Olivia Blackston of\n                     Tucker, Georgia looked back on her time at KSU and eagerly awaited what could be her\n                     last Stuff-An-Owl event. Blackston has lived on campus her whole college career and attends campus events year-round.\n                     She said she loves the sense of community she gets from attending the events and making\n                     friends. She said she especially enjoyed the opportunities to interact with her peers\n                     as the world emerged from the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe went from being isolated to being able to go out and find like-minded individuals, who you might have just walked past before, because of these events that KSU provides every year to try to get people to build connections,\u201d she said.

He\u2019s gone on to serve as a guide on whitewater kayak trips for the program, as well as for whitewater rafting trips with area businesses. For a budding freshman, someone curious about the outdoors or a student just looking\n                     to make friends, joining the group is a no-brainer, Hardaway said. \u201cNature Bound trips are great because they give you an opportunity to try a new experience and meet people you wouldn't have otherwise,\u201d Hardaway said. Nature Bound offers various activities, including rock climbing, backpacking, mountain\n                     biking, whitewater rafting and kayaking, snowboarding, caving and even hang gliding.\n                     The organization began as a club in the 1977-78 academic year and has grown to a capacity\n                     of more than 500 registrants per year, with hopes to continue growing. \n                      \n                      Billy Pownall, senior coordinator for Outdoor Adventures, said Nature Bound is founded on principles of experiential learning, leadership and community and has offerings for every skill level. He said it\u2019s been a joy to watch new members come out of their shells as they explore the outdoors with new friends. He recalled one student who grew from a shy, nervous new member to an outstanding leader. \u201cShe would try to avoid answering questions in group settings. Since then, I have seen her lead presentations very confidently, instruct our staff in our leadership courses, and she's also shared stories with me about her giving very difficult feedback to roommates,\u201d Pownall said. \u201cSeeing students open up and stretch their comfort zone is a very common and gratifying occurrence for me, and I think the practice contributes to comfort in using these skills in everyday life.\u201d Beyond making friends, building life skills and seeking adventure, Hardaway said Nature Bound provides an opportunity to do something that seems rare these days \u2013 enjoying nature without distractions. \u201cIt's okay to put down your phone for two hours and enjoy nature as it was intended: screenless \u2014 except for a sick picture every now and then,\u201d he said Any KSU student, faculty, staff or alum with an Outdoor Adventures membership has\n                     access to sign up for a Nature Bound trip, and on-campus students are automatically\n                     included in that group through their student fees. Trips are subsidized through that fee, and mid-semester trips often range from $10\n                     to $45, while longer trips or more costly activities, like hang gliding or multi-day\n                     trips over breaks, can be more expensive. Most trips have a maximum of 10 participants\n                     and two trip leaders. Nature Bound also provides students on-campus benefits, like\n                     equipment rentals and bike checkouts and repairs.

She earned a silver medal Aug. 10 in the speed climbing world\n                     championship in Bern, Switzerland. A 20-year-old exercise science major from Woodstock, Ga., Hunt posted a time of 6.672\n                     seconds in her second-place finish Aug. 10 in the International Federation of Sport\n                     Climbing (IFSC) World Championships. Desak Made Rita Kusuma Dewi of Indonesia took\n                     the gold medal with a climb of 6.492 seconds. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. It still has not really sunk in yet,\u201d Hunt said Wednesday. \u201cQualifying to compete in Paris is something I have been dreaming of and working toward for a long time.\u201d Hunt began speed climbing in 2015 and within four years was setting records. The proximity between KSU\u2019s Kennesaw Campus and her training gym, Stone Summit Climbing off George Busbee Parkway was convenient, she said. And as her standing in the competitive climbing arena continued to rise, the ability KSU offered to study online was helpful as well. \u201cI have been taking just online classes for a little while now, which is super helpful for my training and travel schedule,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky I can purse my athletic career and college education with facilities for both so close together.\u201d Not many of Hunt\u2019s classmates and professors were even aware she will now be an Olympic athlete. \u201cI have heard from a couple friends that go to KSU. I have been really focused and I didn\u2019t tell many people about the competition so I am not sure how many non-climbing friends or if any professors know,\u201d Hunt said. Speed climbing made its Olympic debut at the Tokyo games in 2020. Competitors climb\n                     a 50-foot wall studded with hand and foot holds. Pairs of climbers race to the top\n                     side-by-side throughout the competitions. Hunt holds the U.S. record. \u201cBeing qualified for the Olympics is still very new, so I am not sure how my training will be different from my current training regiment,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure the volume will ramp up!\u201d \n                      \n                   Hunt won\u2019t be the first Owl to compete in the Olympics.

The Know More, Borrow Less (KMBL) initiative supports the USG\u2019s three primary objectives: graduate more students, be more affordable and be more efficient. This initiative is designed to reduce barriers to aid, improve students\u2019 understanding of borrowing and reduce student debt. To support this initiative, a \u201cdebt letter\u201d will be electronically sent in a mobile-friendly format to every enrolled student who currently has student loan debt resulting from federal or state loan programs, or private lender borrowing. Students will receive both a text and an email providing them a link to a personalized letter containing specific information on monthly payments based on their current loan amounts. Each academic year, students will receive a debt letter, updating them on their cumulative student loan debt. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will have analytics to review the open rate of these messages to ensure students are receiving the information.

The iconic rock musical\u2014with music, lyrics, and book by Jonathan Larson\u2014offers an intimate encounter with a diverse group of young artists living in the lower east side of New York as they struggle to make ends meet during the siege of HIV Aids. Their relationships reinforce the power of a supportive community, and, most of all, the hope and joy that love offers amidst loss and despair.\n                      \n                   Director  , coordinator of Musical Theatre and associate professor of Theatre & Performance Studies, says that \u201cRent\u201d revolutionized the art form of musical theatre, as its songs quickly found their way into popular music by incorporating rock music. \u201cThat hadn\u2019t been heard since \u2018Hair\u2019 in 1968,\u201d she explains, \u201cand the average American was not only interested, but maybe had their hearts and minds educated from seeing theatre.\u201d Larson combined Broadway traditions with contemporary music in a complex way, as the \u201csongs are structured like pop songs\u2014they have pop song structures and are very memorable.\u201d Audience members may be surprised that not only is there just one song that everyone knows, but most people will be surprised by just how many songs they know.\u00a0 \u201cRent\u201d became \u201csomething that was a lot more in the public consciousness across America, certainly more so than most musicals. It\u2019s the kind of show that high schoolers talked about at their lockers,\u201d adds  , chair of the Department of Theatre and Performance Studies.\u00a0 While most of the students performing in this KSU production, set in 1992, weren\u2019t even born when \u201cRent\u201d debuted in 1996 after the AIDS epidemic exploded in the late 1980\u2019s, the actors didn\u2019t have to stretch too much to understand the hardships, especially growing up during tough economic times and COVID-19. \u201cStudents\u2019 rent is going up, and we are having conversations about how to afford eggs vs. books for school. If we did this show ten years ago, we might have to explain a lot more to the cast,\u201d says Morgan. TPS student Lance Avery Brown, who plays Benny, understands the daily challenges. \u201cCollege students can relate to the problems that the characters of \u2018Rent\u2019 are going through; the characters are close in age. They are asking questions that people in their early 20\u2019s wor ry about, like \u2018How am I going to get my rent on time? What is my next meal going to be? How can I be successful? Where do I even start?\u201d Brown adds that it\u2019s important to see that the production covers day-to-day experiences in life, on top of the various themes in \u201cRent.\u201d\u00a0 TPS student and \u201cRent\u201d Assistant Director Issa Sol\u00eds describes the themes of the play as \u201cintersectionality\u201d because \u201cit recognizes that people can have overlapping marginalized identities which can marginalize them even further. In \u2018Rent,\u2019 there are many characters with intersectionalities, which personifies these struggles and helps a modern audience to understand the privileges they have, in order to use that privilege for good,\u201d she says.\u00a0 Of course, Larson addresses the HIV/AIDS crisis head on in \u201cRent.\u201d Patrons will notice quilts on either side of the stage; they are just two of thousands of pieces of the AIDS Memorial Quilt. TPS is the only current host of the AIDS Memorial Quilt in the entire Southeast region of the United States. Morgan notes that \u201cRent\u201d attempts to \u201chumanize the stories of those affected by AIDS as well as additional ills of our society.\u201d \u00a0 Lighting designer and TPS student Mackenzie \u201cMack\u201d Scales hopes that audiences will take away several messages, including \u201cappreciation for the community as well as the struggles those in our community experience\u2014like addiction and identity\u2014and I hope audiences can take ideas away to better support the community around them.\u201d\u00a0 Sol\u00eds wishes that audiences will \u201ctry to walk a mile in the shoes of a character whose identity does not resemble their own. Take in their life experiences, understand their soul. Are you as different as you thought you were at first? Or are we all just \u2018measuring [our lives] in love?\u2019\u201d\u00a0 \u201cRent\u201d will be performed April 6-16 at the Stillwell Theater on the Kennesaw campus.

Kennesaw State\u2019s economic impact in FY 2022 marked an 10.3% increase from $1.84 billion the previous year, while the University System of Georgia\u2019s economic impact grew by 4.14% over fiscal year 2021.

In addition to USG\u2019s annual economic impact study, the system released a companion study that found bachelor\u2019s graduates in the class of 2022 from Georgia\u2019s public colleges and universities will earn over $1 million more during their lifetimes than they would without a degree. \u201cUSG\u2019s 26 public colleges and universities, individually and collectively, make a significant economic impact across the state, helping to put Georgians to work while spending money in local communities and helping their regional economies support Georgia\u2019s growth,\u201d USG Chancellor Sonny Perdue said. \u201cAt the same time, our graduates are the real winners with this million-dollar deal. We\u2019re focused on continuing to help all our students be successful as they use their degrees to prepare themselves for their future prosperity.\u201d The University System\u2019s measure of economic impact reflects direct and indirect spending that contributes to the regions served by its colleges and universities. The report evaluates economic impact in terms of output (sales, plus or minus inventory), value added (gross regional product), labor income and number of jobs. The annual USG study was conducted by the Selig Center for Economic Growth in the University of Georgia\u2019s Terry College of Business, which analyzed data for the period of July 1, 2021, and June 30, 2022, to calculate each school\u2019s economic impact.

This bitter-sweet tribute, started by a small group of loved ones and grew to commemorate the lives of over 50,000 individuals, most of whom were men. During the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, the AIDS Quilt first appeared in the National Mall in D.C. which then only had 1920 panels. After the public release of the quilt people from all over the country began to donate their own quilts and unite across the country. After a 4-month tour in 1988, the quilt tripled in size, raised almost 500K in funds to help those suffering, and then was placed on the grounds of the White House. Each following year, the AID\u2019s Memorial Quilt received more attention and additional panels. Thirty-eight years have passed since its founding and the quilt now has approximately 50,000 panels and has traveled to several cities in the U.S. including Atlanta. The quilt has become a beautiful way for loved ones to keep alive the stories of the thousands of people lost to AIDS and has become a monumental segment of queer history in the U.S.\u00a0 \u00a0 Meet The Director Amanda Wansa Morgan is an Atlanta-based music director, composer, director, and actor who serves as Coordinator of Musical Theatre & Associate Professor at Kennesaw State University.

Wheeler High School seniors Natalie Ajemian and Alex Murray spent the spring semester working alongside faculty and undergraduate students in the department\u2019s award-winning 3D printing lab. Dominic Thomas, an associate professor in the Michael J. Coles College of Business,\n                     established the internship program two years ago to give young people professional\n                     development opportunities before even leaving high school. The initiative began after\n                     a teacher from  reached out to Thomas looking for ways to give her students relevant experience. Today,\n                     the internship program is the only one of its kind for high school students within\n                     the Coles College of Business. Students participating in the program come from STEM magnet programs offered by their respective schools, which often include internship components. Typically, these students secure internships at large technology companies. While there is immense value in these opportunities, the size of the companies means students learn a lot but receive limited hands-on training. Thomas\u2019s Kennesaw State internship program, however, integrates participants into a small team of student workers. As Spring 2023 interns, Ajemin and Murray were tasked with improving the interface and overall usability of the OctoPrint server that manages access to the department\u2019s 3D printers for students, faculty, and staff.  . Prior to this opportunity, neither Ajemian nor Murray had engaged in a project of\n                     similar magnitude and complexity. Throughout the internship, Thomas was constantly\n                     present, offering troubleshooting assistance and motivating them to conquer any obstacles\n                     they encountered. \u201cDevelopment involves many roadblocks,\u201d said Ajemian. \u201cIt was reassuring to have someone with so much experience there anytime we needed help.\u201d One unique aspect of this internship was the inclusion of college students who also\n                     assisted the interns in their projects. This allowed the high school students to gain\n                     insights into the college experience and provided them with valuable mentorship opportunities.\n                     The Kennesaw State students were approachable and available for guidance, answering\n                     any questions the interns had. \u201cHaving the college students there gave me more freedom to learn,\u201d said Murray. \u201cIt gave me a taste of college before I get there.\u201d By offering this hands-on experience, Thomas said is equipping high school students\n                     with the skills and confidence necessary to succeed in their future careers. \u201cProgress is the little steps,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cMy job is to show them they made progress even if they feel like they didn\u2019t.\u201d Both Ajemian and Murray have now graduated from high school after completing their\n                     internship with Thomas. Ajemian has committed to Georgia Tech, where she plans to\n                     pursue a degree in computer science. Murray will be attending Clemson University,\n                     focusing on information systems. Thomas remains committed the internship program and has already secured interns for\n                     the upcoming fall semester. His next objective is to acquire funding for the program\n                     and transform it into a paid internship. By continuing to invest in the education\n                     and career development of young individuals, Thomas is making a profound impact on\n                     their lives and helping to shape the workforce of the future. \u201cThis internship gives students the opportunity to create and build something at a level they have never experienced before,\u201d said Thomas.

The primary objective of this graduate business\n                     education abroad course was to gain a comprehensive understanding of Israel's business\n                     landscape, political climate, social dynamics, and technological advancements. Throughout the experience, Gala encouraged students to recognize the significant role culture plays in business and to understand the factors that influence Israel\u2019s business environment. For example, students learned how the country\u2019s scarce water supply has led to countless innovations, such as the creation of the Netafim irrigation system and many other advancements in agriculture designed to conserve water. Also, by engaging with the daily life and language of Israelis, the students developed\n                     a deeper appreciation for cultural diversity and gained empathy, tolerance, and cultural\n                     sensitivity. Immersion in another culture allowed them to gain a global perspective,\n                     which broadened their horizons and enhanced their understanding of different customs,\n                     traditions, and ways of life. \u201cWhat surprised me the most about was how multifaceted their culture was,\u201d said, MBA student Sheri Blight. \u201cThey have a blend of Jewish, Muslim, secular, i, Palestinian, and more meshed together to lead to impressive innovation. It was exciting to have a trip dedicated to seeing more about how a country works from the business side.\u201d In addition to cultural understanding, the program also provided students with an opportunity to learn about the country\u2019s importance to multiple world religions. Israel's rich history, particularly its Jewish, Christian, and Islamic heritage, was explored through visits to historical and religious sites such as Jerusalem, the Dead Sea, and Masada. This firsthand experience deepened the students\u2019 understanding of ancient civilizations, biblical narratives, and the complexities of the Middle East. \u201cThere were people from many different faiths in our travel group  Muslim, Hindu, Christian and agnostic,\u201d said MBA student Maria Bayot De Hiteshew. \u201cThis was a fascinating experience with true diversity and inclusion as everyone shared their individual perspectives.\u201d Cultural immersion was only half of the experience, which also included a rigorous\n                     academic component. Before departing for Israel, the students attended two classes\n                     on Israeli politics, economics, and business. They presented on various topics including\n                     consumer privacy, multiculturalism from an Israeli business perspective, startups\n                     in Israel, and the effect of Israel's rich cultural heritage on the business world.\n                     These presentations allowed the students to delve into the intricacies of the Israeli\n                     business market and gain a comprehensive understanding of its Israeli and global contexts \u201cThe business world is global,\u201d said Blight. \u201cAs an MBA student, this experience gave me a better view of how different countries and different cultures approach problems in the business world.\u201d Furthermore, the students analyzed three case studies during the program. These cases,\n                     which included topics like rebranding a country, Israeli wines' expansion into China,\n                     and the future of the Israeli innovation ecosystem, provided real-world examples for\n                     the students to apply their knowledge and analytical skills. Throughout their time in Israel, the students were also required to reflect on their\n                     daily activities and learnings. These daily reflections served as a means to process\n                     their experiences and further deepen their understanding of the business marketplace\n                     and cultural nuances of Israel. The reflections played a significant role in fostering\n                     lively discussions among the students during casual meetups even after the trip concluded,\n                     showing the lasting impact of the program. Gala believes the MBA students can apply their experiences throughout their entire\n                     careers. \u201cOne essential take away from the trip was the quote  innovation is the mother of necessity said Gala. \u201cIsrael strives on this saying and every unique business we learned about was a record of that. Graduate students not only learned about the culture, but also their discovered passion and determination to survive and make the best out of the resources they possess.\u201d The Comparative Business Systems in Israel program provided MBA students with an invaluable\n                     opportunity to gain firsthand knowledge of Israel's history, economy, and business\n                     markets. Through cultural immersion, historical exploration, and academic enrichment,\n                     the students developed a global mindset gained from insights into the complexities\n                     of the Israeli business environment. The program not only expanded their academic\n                     knowledge but also provided them with practical experiences that will benefit their\n                     future careers in an increasingly interconnected and globalized world.

Cybersecurity Degree Student Journeys Kennesaw State University\u2019s Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity program has greatly contributed to my growth both professionally and personally. After graduation, I was able to join a young and rapidly-growing cybersecurity firm in the Atlanta area, which allowed me to quickly jump into the world of consulting. This was all thanks to connections I formed during my time at KSU. I've since been able to grow into a full-time career as a penetration tester and red teamer, helping organizations secure their critical assets and helping to reduce business risk. My experiences from the CYBR program have been extremely valuable during this entire process. The technical and managerial concepts taught in the courses aided me in multiple real-world settings and projects. Additionally, I\u2019d argue that the extracurricular opportunities at KSU, such as the Offensive Security club and SECCDC competition, are key differentiators for the program, and are nearly equal to the value of an entire undergraduate degree in themselves. If you are local to the Atlanta area, it\u2019s also worth noting the extremely advantageous location that KSU possesses. The Atlanta technology sector is growing rapidly, with many large organizations in the city seeking talented individuals from universities like KSU. Kennesaw State University alumna Madison Loewe graduated summa cum laude in Spring\n                                    2021. For her graduating class, she was recognized as the Cybersecurity Student of\n                                    the Year. This honor had been noticed by Risk3sixty, and they reached out to Loewe\n                                    about an interview. While going through the interview process, she noticed that she\n                                    enjoyed talking to the team and reading their content online and determined that this\n                                    was the place for her. Soon after, Loewe was an Associate at Risk3sixty and worked\n                                    within the GRC space with their SOC 2 team. The material she had learned throughout\n                                    her college journey had been integral to understanding the work she would be doing\n                                    and preparing her to face the challenges of cybersecurity. In her role, she is continuously\n                                    learning and growing as she interacts with many aspects of the cybersecurity field,\n                                    from configurations to vendor management to penetration test reports, with many different\n                                    business models. By April of 2022, she had been promoted to Senior Associate. Since\n                                    then, Loewe has published content related to the SOC 2 attestation process, begun\n                                    participating in a book club for professional development, and been studying for certifications.

It depends on how much relevant information you can provide in a clear and concise\n                                                      manner. The general rule is:\u00a0 One page for recent college or post-college graduates. Two pages for 10+ years of professional experience in the field. Three pages for experienced professionals submitting a federal resume or curriculum\n                                                      vitae (CV). A CV is a special resume format most commonly used for academic, fine\n                                                      arts, medical, and legal job searches. Is an Objective Statement required? \u00a0No. The inclusion of an objective statement is optional.\u00a0 The general rule is: If one is included, it should articulate the skills, abilities, and experiences you\n                                                      have that match the requirements needed for the position. It should not focus on the\n                                                      needs of the candidate, but those of the employer. Should references be included on the resume? No. A separate document is created to list references. The general rule is: Three references are usually enough. References should include individuals who are familiar with your academic and/or work\n                                                      performance. Personal references (family and friends) are only used when specifically requested. Reference information should include: name, title, place of employment, mailing address,\n                                                      email address, and phone number. Do resumes require a certain font size and style? A. No. The use of extremely large and/or flashy fonts is not recommended. The general rule is: Use one or two font sizes across the entire resume. A larger font size can be used\n                                                      for section headings. Standard font styles, such as Calibri (11), Arial (11), or Times\n                                                      New Roman (12) are recommended. Should personal pronouns be used on a resume? No. Most of the time. The general rule is: The use of personal pronouns (I, me, my, our, you, their, she, he) should be avoided. The use of I, me or my could be used in an objective statement. What is the best resume template to use? Resume templates are NOT recommended. Employers can immediately tell a resume template\n                                                      was used, and are usually not impressed. The general rule is: It is best to create a resume from scratch using a blank Microsoft Word document. Focus on style and format after you have written the content. Should high school information be included? Usually not. The general rule is: Freshman level college students who have limited work experience may list outstanding\n                                                      achievements to demonstrate potential. This information should be removed once relevant\n                                                      skills have been gained through collegiate/work experiences. Must a street address be listed on the resume? There are different points of view on this issue, so it becomes a personal choice. Some general thoughts: Due to the increase of identity theft, it is acceptable to only list an email address\n                                                      and phone number. Others contend this information is readily available to the general\n                                                      public, so listing an address does not increase your risk. Should GPA be included on the resume? Including a GPA is optional. The general rule is: Recent graduates should include a GPA of 3.0 or higher. If the overall GPA is not\n                                                      a 3.0 or higher, listing the major GPA if it is higher is an option. You must clearly\n                                                      distinguish whether you are reporting an overall or major GPA. It is important to\n                                                      be accurate because you may be asked to verify this information. GPAs are should not\n                                                      be rounded up. Job seekers who have related work experience and have been out of school\n                                                      for 3+ years do not need to include GPA. Can coursework and class projects be included on the resume? Yes. Recent graduates who have completed relevant coursework or projects. The general rule is: Relevant courses and projects should be listed on the resume as a way to demonstrate academic and applied knowledge of the subject. Descriptions should highlight teamwork, writing skills, analytical abilities, etc. the employer is seeking.\u00a0 Should campus/volunteer activities be listed on the resume? Yes. Employers are interested in knowing what non-acadmic experiences you have on\n                                                      and off campus. The general rule is: Include activities that will highlight leadership potential, interests, and the ability\n                                                      to manage multiple responsibilities.

CEO Tim Cook. \u00a0 \u201cHe likes baseball like I do,\u201d Agesin said. \u201cPlus, he was wearing shoes with Jackie Robinson\u2019s No. 42 on them, and the Atlanta Braves are his favorite team. Isn\u2019t that cool?\u201d\u00a0 It was baseball that brought Agesin face-to-face with the leader of one of the world\u2019s leading technology companies. \u00a0 \n                      \n                   The senior computer science major in the College of Computing and Software Engineering created a fun and addicting baseball game app where players hit pitches against an unpredictable AI. The app was among the top nine entries in Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference Swift Student Challenge. In the challenge, students are tasked with creating an original app using the Swift coding language. \u00a0 The nine students with the top apps presented their work to Cook and the company\u2019s head of marketing, Susan Prescott. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe each had to have a script prepared to meet the time constraints,\u201d Agesin said. \u201cBut, when I saw Tim Cook, I completely forgot my script because I was so nervous. But he had this way of making me feel invited and not intimidated. He just asked me questions about my app, so it was like we were having this conversation.\u201d\u00a0 Agesin was born in New Jersey, but because of his parent\u2019s jobs as Senior Clinical Data Managers and their genuine interest in travel, he grew up around the world, living in England, Germany, Nigeria, and Belgium. He graduated high school in Lawrenceville, Ga. He became obsessed with coding at an early age. \u00a0 \u201cCoding is not like math with its set rules,\u201d Agesin explained. \u201cCoding is more like art because there are multiple ways to accomplish something. I see myself as the artist and coding is the medium. It feels really powerful.\u201d\u00a0 Although Agesin hasn\u2019t played baseball since middle school, the app he created to win the Apple challenge was baseball themed. He said his interest in baseball grew after working at a sports tracking company as a baseball systems operator the last two years.\u00a0 \u201cI feel like some people find baseball boring,\u201d Agesin said. \u201cBut there are actually a lot of smaller nuances going on. To me, the most fun and dynamic routine is between the batter and the pitcher. It\u2019s like two people having a fight without having an actual fight.\u201d \u00a0 Agesin had wanted to enter the Apple challenge in prior years, but due to time restraints with school, he was unable. Because he is graduating from Kennesaw State later this year, he knew this was his last chance. He received an email in early summer letting him know he had won.\u00a0 \u201cIt was really exciting,\u201d Agesin said. \u201cThere was this big page of congratulations letting me know there were a certain number of winners, and Apple\u2019s PR team reached out to me letting me know that they were really impressed with my app and wanted to hear more of my story.\u201d\u00a0 The prizes included some Apple logo clothing, Air Pods Pro, and a customized pen set.\n                     But the prize Agesin is most interested in is the one-year membership in the Apple\n                     Developer Program. Agesin plans to finalize his baseball app, which he is calling\n                      , for mass release, and he has dreams of doing even more. \u00a0 \u201cI have this mission,\u201d Agesin said. \u201cI want to use technology to help people to improve both their careers and their lives. With coding, you can conjure something up from nothing like a game that is fun, or you can also create an app that could help millions of people.\u201d \u00a0 Kennesaw State student earns spot in speed climbing for 2024 Olympics in Paris Fun programs have serious purpose to engage Kennesaw State students Kennesaw State economic impact climbs to more than $2 billion in 2022 Kennesaw State program offers community, adventure in the great outdoors A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its more than 43,000 students.

The new program was developed by associate professor of prosthetics and orthotics G\u00e9za Kogler who helped establish the   program in the   at Kennesaw State. Kogler credited associate professor of mechanical engineering\n                     technology Turaj Ashuri and professor emeritus of electrical engineering Bill Diong\n                     for connecting the grant to the  .

The Kennesaw State program connects with the NIH\u2019s   (Enhancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Educational Diversity) program, which seeks to \u201csupport educational activities that enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce through early preparation for undergraduate students in STEM fields,\u201d specifically bioengineering. Kogler has named the program the BRITE project (Bioengineering Research and Interdisciplinary Training\u2014ESTEEMED). Students involved in BRITE will have their tuition paid for their first two years, then will enter the KSU Journey Honors College for their final two years, where they will have access to other sources of funding. They\u2019ll also receive stipends for summer work through the program. The program addresses points of emphasis at Kennesaw State, most prominently interdisciplinary\n                     studies and pathways to graduate degree programs. \u201cEspecially with bioengineering, you're looking at a very interdisciplinary field that takes in math, physics, biology and engineering,\u201d Kogler said. \u201cA student might develop expertise in a certain aspect of engineering or science and they\u2019re applying those skills in a space that could be clinically valuable, or it could be on the research side to solve a problem.\u201d The grant was awarded in early July, and the program will start with its inaugural\n                     group of eight students for the Fall 2023 semester. In each of the next three years,\n                     BRITE will admit another eight students for a total of 32 in the program. \u201cNormally a grant has a massive impact for a lab, but this one will affect the entire university on both campuses,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the tentacles of this grant have an extended reach, and it's not very often you get an opportunity to connect students and faculty in such a transformative way.\u201d Kennesaw State student earns spot in speed climbing for 2024 Olympics in Paris Kennesaw State nursing major finds success in data science The Home Depot donations boost Kennesaw State's inclusive academy Kennesaw State student finds direction in chemistry with Double-Owl program A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its more than 43,000 students.

Program participants audit one typical university course per semester, while taking an additional three classes specific to the academy. Additionally, each student takes a course through the College of Professional Education. Students also receive academic and career counseling support, participate in internships\n                     and work with peer counselors, KSU students who advise and assist them in their audited\n                     classes and encourage campus social engagement.

Katz Music & Entertainment Business Program Among the Best - Coles College of Business", "body": "Resources For Resources For For the second year in a row, Billboard Magazine has recognized the Joel A. Katz Music\n                     and Entertainment Business Program for making Kennesaw State University one of the\n                     top music business schools in the country. Launched in 2010 within the Michael J. Coles College of Business, the MEBUS program\n                     teaches students to thrive in the fast-paced world of film, television, and music\n                     production, as well as in artist, venue, and live event management. With courses taught\n                     by professional actors and Grammy Award-winning recording artists, students exit the\n                     program prepared to work real entertainment industry jobs. \n                      \n                   Billboard published its list of the top music business schools in the magazine\u2019s March 23 issue. The MEBUS program, which also made the list last year, was featured alongside other programs from prominent schools like Belmont University, Berklee College of Music, New York University, and Syracuse University. MEBUS Program Director Keith Perissi says that receiving the honor two years in a\n                     row clearly demonstrates the strength of the young program. \u201cIt was definitely an honor and privilege to be included as one of Billboard Magazine\u2019s Top Music Business School in 2018 after only eight years of existence,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact that it was not a one-time recognition means that we are achieving national prominence for our University, our students, and our namesake, benefactor, and legendary entertainment attorney, Joel A. Katz.\u201d Among the elements of the MEBUS program praised by Billboard were its curriculum \u2013 including courses in accounting, marketing, management, entrepreneurship, audio & video production \u2013 and its frequent partnerships with entertainment industry businesses. \n                      The magazine specifically called out last fall\u2019s Future X Live conference. MEBUS partnered with marketing firm Moxie to produce the largest augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality conference in the Southeast. FutureX Live focused on the entertainment industry\u2019s response to new and emerging technologies. Among the guests at FutureX Live were Scott Tigchelaar, president of Raleigh Studios,\n                     Dan Rosenfelt, president of Third Rail Studios, and Chaka Zulu, co-founder of Disturbing\n                     tha Peace Records and manager to rapper and actor Ludacris. \n                      MEBUS students not only have the opportunity to interact with working entertainment\n                     industry professionals at conferences, but also in the classroom. Two members of the\n                     Grammy Award-winning Zac Brown Band, John Driskell Hopkins and Coy Bowles, are artists-in-residence,\n                     while Beth Keener, a local actor recently on the Walking Dead, also lectures on the\n                     Georgia film and TV industries. MEBUS students worked with Billboard-charting recording\n                     artist Leah Culver during the lead-up to FutureX Live to create a first-of-its-kind\n                     augmented reality concert. \u201cThe Katz MEBUS program is a training ground for bringing entertainment industry experts to campus to teach students on state-of-the-art equipment,\u201d Perissi says, \u201cand to give them the chance to learn from industry professionals on up-to-the-minute industry practices to get them hired.\u201d This strategy works. MEBUS alumni can be found working for high-profile entertainment businesses like Live Nation, Turner Sports, State Farm Arena, Sixthman, Red Light Management, Coca-Cola Studios, Moxie, Polay Financial, and even Joel Katz\u2019s law firm Greenberg Traurig. \n                      Built on a foundation of three key principles \u2013 experiential learning opportunities, entertainment industry partnerships, and exemplary education \u2013 the MEBUS program is one of Kennesaw State\u2019s most unique academic offerings, and one that continues to garner international recognition.

Speaking to students in the Kennesaw State University Michael J. Coles College of\n                     Business, Goldstuck discussed how streaming services and online videos have helped\n                     the industry rebound from the hit caused by piracy and filesharing in the 2000s. \n                      \n                   \u201cThe predictions me and my partners made thanks to Spotify, YouTube, and Apple started happening as people were willing to pay for subscription services,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has been responsible for the rebirth of the music industry in terms of its commercial health. Creatively, the music industry has never wanted.\u201d Goldstuck is founder and co-chairman of music and entertainment company Hitco. He previously was president \u2013 and later executive chairman \u2013 of TouchTunes, which operates 190,000 internet-enabled jukeboxes worldwide. His career also includes five years as president and chief operating officer of Sony Music Entertainment\u2019s BMG music labels, where he worked with popular artists like Usher, Alicia Keys, Dave Matthews Band, and Foo Fighters. Hosted by the Coles College\u2019s  , Goldstuck\u2019s presentation, called \u201cThe Future of Music and Entertainment,\u201d focused on how technology is helping grow the industry, and how aspiring professionals can use it to launch their careers. He described multiple avenues into the music industry that never existed 20 years\n                     ago, many related to social media. \u201cWhen I look at the industry today, the whole digital media environment and digital market is so in need of talent,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd experience isn\u2019t what\u2019s required, it\u2019s a creative sense around digital media. That\u2019s one of the biggest growth areas not just for music, but for all content-driven businesses.\u201d Goldstuck also recommended that students interested in breaking into the entertainment\n                     industry consider working for one of the major social media platforms, which have\n                     recently become players in the space. Music-adjacent jobs exist in the areas of content\n                     curation, editorial, and technology and product development. \u201cIt used to be that if you wanted to be in music, you had to work for an artist and go on the road, go to a label, or go to a music publisher,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, when you look at hiring practices at companies like Google and Facebook/Instagram, those companies will hire 1,000 people in the next year in and around content. Intake of entry level players in the music industry and affiliated companies in music is at an all-time high.\u201d Rounding out his presentation to the group of aspiring entertainment industry professionals, Goldstuck partially debunked the popular adage that people should always do what they love. Instead amending it to say, \u201cdo some of what you love, but add to that what can practically move your career forward.\u201d He referenced his own love of music and desire to work in the industry. Once he realized his skills were in talent development and promotion \u2013 not musical composition or performance \u2013 he nurtured those into a successful career. While professionals should have a passion for their field, he said, it is equally\n                     important that they gain experience in the areas where their talents lay. Goldstuck\u2019s visit was made possible thanks to the MEBUS program\u2019s relationship to its namesake Joel A. Katz, one of the most prolific working entertainment industry attorneys, who represents a variety of high-profile artists such as Justin Timberlake, Jimmy Buffett, the Jackson family, Kenny Chesney, and many others. \u00a0\u201cOur program is able to attract entertainment business experts like Charles Goldstuck thanks to our remarkable benefactor Joel Katz,\u201d says MEBUS Program Director Keith Perissi. \u201cOur students benefitted from Charles\u2019s vast knowledge and experience on important industry practices that will help prepare them to get hired.\u201d \n                      MEBUS is a 24-credit certificate program offering three capstone courses in music\n                     & entertainment business as well as marketing, management, production, communication,\n                     and entrepreneurship courses that prepare students for successful careers in the entertainment\n                     industry. MEBUS is open to all KSU undergraduate majors with a desire to work in the\n                     entertainment industry in areas such as film and television production, audio and\n                     video technology, venue and artist management, and concert and event production.

Gordon learned about KSU\u2019s\u00a0Center for Young Adult Addiction and Recovery (CYAAR), and thought it was just what he needed once he had been sober for a year and was ready to tackle attending college. He now credits his involvement with CYAAR for helping him thrive at Kennesaw State, as he is on track to graduate in December 2020 with an accounting degree. \n                      \u00a0 \u201cWithout this program, I would not still be in school,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful support system because we\u2019re all in this together. Everybody has gone through similar circumstances, so you have the sense that you\u2019re not alone.\u201d It certainly hasn\u2019t been easy, though. Gordon describes his first semester at Kennesaw State as \u201ca disaster. It was the toughest challenge that I\u2019ve ever faced in my life.\u201d Gordon said that his car broke down during his first week of classes at KSU. His laptop computer crashed. He was laid off from his job. Money was so tight that he couldn\u2019t buy all the textbooks he needed and he exhausted his meal plan after about a month.\u00a0 \u201cHere I\u2019ve made this big decision to go back to school at 29 years old, being a recovering alcoholic and on the verge of trying to change my life, and it all falls apart,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cIt was a very scary time.\u201d \n                      Gordon got through it with the help of CYAAR. He became nearly a daily fixture at\n                     their office, whether he was seeking advice from staff members, participating in programs,\n                     spending time with other students in recovery or accessing the computer lab. His first\n                     semester that had started so poorly ended with Gordon earning a 4.0 grade point average. Meanwhile, paying for college \u201cremains the uphill battle that I face every semester,\u201d Gordon said. CYAAR has assisted him through directly providing scholarships and helping him find other agencies that have provided financial aid. \u201cThe financial support from CYAAR is life-changing. They say, \u2018We\u2019re going to keep the dream alive for you,\u2019\u201d Gordon said. \u201cI went from thinking, \u2018This is extremely difficult and I don\u2019t know if I can do this,\u2019 to, \u2018This gave me the confidence that I needed and I know that I\u2019m going to do this no matter what life throws at me.\u2019\u201d \n                      \n                   Gordon joined 30 other students today in receiving scholarships totaling $55,500 at the CYAAR Collegiate Recovery Scholarship Breakfast. The annual event celebrates student successes and thanks supporters for donating funds for CYAAR\u2019s endowed and non-endowed scholarships as well as the student-learning initiatives in its\u00a0Collegiate Recovery Program.\u00a0 Another of this year\u2019s scholarship recipients was Cassie Bramblett, who received the Mandy Krasner Memorial Scholarship. The new scholarship was established to honor Krasner \u2013 described as \u201ca beautiful, warm, caring, artistic and energetic young lady\u201d \u2013 who died accidentally at age 26 after battling an eating disorder. \u201cBlake and Cassie are just two examples that, when students in recovery are given the academic and recovery supports they need, they succeed,\u201d said CYAAR Executive Director Teresa Johnston. \u201cThe most important part of our work, the heart of our work, is our students. Providing the opportunity to attain an education while in recovery from addiction provides hope and a second chance.\u201d Gordon is making the most of that chance, as he works toward his goal of becoming\n                     a certified public accountant. Wherever his career takes him following his graduation\n                     from Kennesaw State, Gordon plans to remain actively involved in supporting CYAAR. \u201cI want to be that mentor to somebody who has struggled with the same thing that I have,\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing for certain is that I want to give back as much as I can to this program that has given me everything.\u201d Kennesaw State names recipients of 2023 Alumni Awards Kennesaw State economic impact climbs to more than $2 billion in 2022 Kennesaw State University MBA Students Explore Israel's Business Landscape Coles College Professor Provides Internship Opportunities for Local High School Students Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

Made possible by a generous gift from Michael A. Leven, chairman and CEO of the Georgia Aquarium and namesake of the Leven School, the new endowed chair will serve a critical role in developing Kennesaw State University\u2019s new undergraduate degree program in hospitality, which is expected to launch in fall 2020. Leven has co-founded many hospitality franchises throughout his career and is currently\n                     a leading industry spokesperson who promotes the development of hospitality programs\n                     at educational institutions across the country. This endowed chair is the latest of\n                     those efforts. Madanoglu, who joined\u00a0Kennesaw State's Michael J.

However, Casto told the students, the same principles that served him well in Fukushima can be utilized by anyone who is in a leadership position. In his lecture on campus hosted by KSU\u2019s\u00a0Honors College, Casto offered a concise directive. \u201cWhen you get an opportunity to lead,\u201d he said, \u201cLead.\u201d \n                      \n                   Casto, a Kennesaw State alumnus, led a team of American experts who addressed the\n                     challenges in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear power plant meltdown. He saw qualities\n                     in that team that he passed along to the students: Leaders promote a clear and compelling\n                     vision and strategy, cultivate and foster continuous improvement, and set a personal\n                     example by their behaviors. \u201cWhether a small or large effort, gain as much leadership experience as possible,\u201d Casto said. \u201cThen use those experiences, good or bad, as a foundation for continuous improvement. Finally, be ready so that when the call comes \u2013 whether early in your career, mid- or late-career \u2013 you'll set a great example as a leader and have successful outcomes.\u201d Casto wrote the book Station Blackout about his 11 months as the director for site operations in Japan responding to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. Each student who attended Monday\u2019s lecture received a copy of the book.\u00a0 That included Honors students from both the Kennesaw and Marietta campuses who read Station Blackout in a book club that is this semester\u2019s Honors Discovery. An Honors Discovery is a non-graded course on a special topic of study that students can participate in outside of typical course structures. \u201cIt was fantastic because I was able to hear the effect that this book had on students from different majors with different perspectives,\u201d said Susanna Grafton, a sophomore majoring in business management. \u201cWe also would think about how this can apply to our future careers. I\u2019m hoping to be accepted into officer training for the Air Force, so the leadership principles are extremely important for me to develop.\u201d \n                      \n                   Casto outlined the events of March 11, 2011, when a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and 45-foot high tsunami slammed eastern Japan, causing three reactor cores to melt down at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. What ensued, Casto said, was \u201cunfathomable challenges with amazing feats of heroism,\u201d such as a team of plant operators who navigated the hazardous conditions to try to reach specific valves in order to relieve pressure inside the reactor. \u201cIt was a kamikaze mission. They all thought that no one would come back from it,\u201d Casto said. \u201cThey tried three times, but they couldn\u2019t vent the reactor in time before the building exploded.\u201d Casto also commended the operators who remained in the chaos of the control room, working in the dark with flashlights and having no knowledge of what the radiation level was. He quoted a good-bye text that one of the workers sent to his child: \u201cYour dad will be here until the end. Take care of your mom.\u201d \u201cMost people would say, \u2018I want to get out of here,\u2019\u201d Casto said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know where your family is and what condition your home is in. But they had to stay.\u201d\u00a0 Within that crisis are lessons that any leaders can apply to their organizations, Casto said. For example, how does a leader deal with people\u2019s emotions? \u201cWhen you have a situation causing fear and uncertainty, you have to provide as much information as possible to your people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might not be able to tell them everything at that moment, but what can we tell them to reduce their uncertainty?\u201d\u00a0 The leadership lessons resonated with KSU junior Abigail Haines, a political science\n                     major. She read Station Blackout with the Honors book club, then gained further insight\n                     from listening to Casto speak. \u201cMy main takeaway would be how to apply those types of crisis management skills into everyday life,\u201d Haines said. \u201cObviously this was a terrible accident and it\u2019s not going to happen all the time, but it\u2019s a look inside leadership and how to apply it to what you\u2019re doing.\u201d The Beacon Foundation sponsored Casto\u2019s lecture and book signing. The foundation is a frequent supporter of Kennesaw State, including annual contributions for international travel for students in the   (PEGS)\u00a0program and to   (CARE)\u00a0Services. \u201cWe are delighted that the gift from the Beacon Foundation allowed us to sponsor this special presentation by Dr. Charles Casto,\u201d said Rita Bailey, dean of the Honors College. \u201cFor him to relay his experience as an international leader in crisis management was invaluable. Students heard firsthand about his leadership experiences in the middle of an absolute crisis. This was an amazing opportunity and something I personally will never forget.

According to Hector Padilla, president of The Home Depot\u2019s Southern Division, they key is to live in the moment, surround yourself with the right people, and become a lifelong learner. Padilla spoke to students in the Michael J. Coles College of Business on Thursday\n                     as part of the Tetley Distinguished Leader Lecture Series. Started in 1990 with an\n                     endowment from Tetley Tea CEO Hank McInerney, the Tetley series brings exceptional\n                     Atlanta-area business leaders to campus each semester to inspire students. \n                      \n                   As The Home Depot\u2019s Southern Division president, Padilla oversees 690 retail locations and 100,000 associates in 15 states, Puerto Rico, and St. Thomas. He previously served as the company\u2019s senior vice president, where he was responsible for improving efficiency at nearly 2,000 locations. Padilla emigrated from the Dominican Republic in 1994 at the age of 19 and got a job making $6 an hour at The Home Depot\u2019s store in Hialeah, Fla. During the next 25 years, he would hold a series of leadership positions in the department, store, and district levels, before joining Home Depot\u2019s corporate offices. \u201cMy story is not unique to me,\u201d Padilla said to an auditorium of Kenesaw State students, most of them business majors. \u201cMy boss has been with the company for 30+ years. She started as a cashier.\u201d During his presentation, titled \u201cKnow Where You\u2019re Going,\u201d Padilla outlined the strategies that allowed him to achieve success, adding that students could apply them to advance their own careers. These strategies include: Padilla said it is important for professionals to have a clear career goal they are\n                     working towards, and that becoming an active listener is a valuable tool for developing\n                     intentionality. \u201cListen for the words. Look at the facial expressions. Pay attention,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you pay attention, you remember things and you put things together\u2026Being in the moment means that you are learning.\u201d He believes leaders should surround themselves with supportive people who can provide\n                     new perspectives and help solve problems in unique ways. This applies to friends,\n                     teachers, coworkers, and employees. Padilla was quick to say that this is different than traditional networking, which\n                     can sometimes reduce relationships to transactions. \u201cI\u2019ve never subscribed to that because, for me, it\u2019s never been about who you know,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are in an organization where you have to know people to get somewhere, then you are in the wrong organization. [Investing in relationships] is about how you make people feel, how you manage yourself, and how you challenge yourself. It\u2019s about the opportunities you have earned, not that the relationships are going to get you somewhere just because you have them.\u201d Leaders should always seek to improve their skills, Padilla said. Whether it is pursuing additional education \u2013 like he did when he recently earned his Executive Master of Business Administration from University of Miami \u2013 or simply researching a skill you want to develop, Padilla urged the attendees to be lifelong learners. Once a quarter, Padilla writes out a list of his strengths and his opportunities for improvement, and then develops strategies for improving his performance. To reinforce the importance of writing things down, Padilla provided each student at the event with a canvas journal in The Home Depot\u2019s signature orange. \n                      \n                   Padilla devoted half the event to Q&A, fielding student questions about how to move\n                     up in their organizations, overcoming shortcomings, and what sacrifices they should\n                     make to succeed. Dylan Malec, a senior in the professional sales program, works as an associate for The Home Depot and is interviewing for an internship with the company\u2019s store operations organization. He said that meeting Padilla cemented his desire to continue his career there. \u201cIt\u2019s like meeting a celebrity,\u201d he said, adding that Padilla recommended he emphasize his passions on his resume. \u201cI never really thought about it that way. On my resume I never talked about how passionate I am about helping others or about being involved in an areas I love to be in.\u201d \n                      \n                   Padilla said working with young people \u2013 whether in his role at The Home Depot or at events like the Tetley lecture \u2013 is \u201cenergizing.\u201d \u201cThe younger generation is coming into the workplace super-prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of it has to do with how driven they are and how much access to information they have. They are coming in at a much richer place than I was when I was starting out. That\u2019s energizing.\u201d Kennesaw State names recipients of 2023 Alumni Awards Kennesaw State economic impact climbs to more than $2 billion in 2022 Kennesaw State University MBA Students Explore Israel's Business Landscape Coles College Professor Provides Internship Opportunities for Local High School Students Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

Perpetrators are increasingly relying on social engineering in their schemes, which\n                     is the ability to manipulate people into unwittingly sending money or providing access\n                     to sensitive information. \n                      \n                   The Michael J. Coles College of Business this week hosted the Symposium on Social Engineering. Organized by the Department of Information Systems in partnership with the EC-Council \u2013 the world\u2019s largest cybersecurity technical certification body \u2013 the event introduced current and future cybersecurity professionals to the threat social engineering poses to businesses and individuals. Speakers included cybersecurity experts Jenny Radcliffe and Joe Gray. Radcliffe is\n                     the founder and social engineering director of Human Factor Security, and host of\n                     the award-winning The Human Factor Podcast. Gray formerly served as a submarine navigation\n                     electronics technician for the U.S. Navy before founding an information security blog\n                     and podcast called Advanced Persistent Security. \n                      Both presenters discussed different social engineering strategies criminals use, including\n                     (but not limited to): Social engineering is an expensive problem. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n                     business email compromise alone accounted for $12.5 billion in losses globally in\n                     2018. What makes social engineering attacks so successful is that they rely on human error,\n                     rather than technological deficiencies. \u201cTechnology typically doesn\u2019t fail,\u201d Gray said, \u201cpeople do. I see social engineering...as the biggest information security threat facing personal and business computer networks.\u201d \n                      \n                   His presentation addressed how perpetrators take advantage of publicly available information to improve their chances for success, and how security professionals can learn from phishing attempts to better protect their company\u2019s employees from falling victim. Radcliffe, who developed her persuasion skills working in the logistics and supply\n                     chain industries, has been helping organizations become more aware of social engineering\n                     attacks for the past 10 years. \u201cSocial engineering targets our human characteristics,\u201d she said. \u201cOur fears, our desires, and our cognitive processes. We are all at risk and need to be aware of the threat and the forms it may take in order to protect ourselves.\u201d Information Security and Assurance lecturer Andy Green was the chief organizer of\n                     the symposium. His goal was to remind students and young professionals that cybersecurity\n                     is about more than implementing technical controls. \u201cRight now there is a lot of focus on building technical controls and policies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, if an adversary can convince the victim to do something, then every one of those controls and policies gets defeated.\u201d With many attendees being students in Kennesaw State\u2019s various cybersecurity-related degree programs \u2013 including  ,  , and the   \u2013 the presenters offered advice about starting a cybersecurity career. \u201cDon\u2019t discount other disciplines,\u201d said Gray, referring to the important roles that psychology and sociology play in defense against social engineering. \u201cAlso, find a passion and follow it.\u201d Radcliffe echoed his sentiments, recommending that students learn about how humans\n                     think in addition to how computer networks function. \u201cLearn as much about the humans as the tech,\u201d she said. \u201cUnderstand that a career in cybersecurity should always be about protecting people and, to do that effectively, we must understand them.

A Kennesaw State University\n                     senior hosted a leadership panel recently that he says will convince his fellow students\n                     of this. Entrepreneurship student Christian \u201cCeeJ\u201d Brown\u00a0hosted the Your Visionary Leadership Panel on Saturday, Oct. 19 at 5 pm in the Carmichael Student Center University Rooms. The event was co-organized by the Kennesaw State Enactus team, which\u00a0hosted a summit the same day.\u00a0 \n                      \n                   Brown is host of the Your Visionary Podcast, which sees him interviewing local entrepreneurs\n                     and other leaders to encourage young people to pursue their dreams. He invited some\n                     of his most popular guests to participate in the panel discussion and share their\n                     inspirational stories with a live audience. The five presenters include: \u201cIt was very important to me that each of the speakers be in different areas of their lives,\u201d says Brown, \u201cbecause I think there are things you can learn from anyone. I like the fact that they are all going different ways, but they are all going in the right direction.\u201d The event is a live recording of Brown\u2019s podcast, which has released 23 episodes since launching in December 2018. Produced alongside the Kennesaw State chapter of socially responsible entrepreneurship organization Enactus, Your Visionary Podcast has more than 2,500 unique listeners. As with each episode of his show, the goal of the panel is to help people realize that the ability to be successful is not something\u00a0they are born with, but something that they can learn. \u201cI hope they take away that leadership is a universal skill that is invaluable in any industry,\u201d he says, \u201cand it is something you can intentionally get better at. It\u2019s just about getting the right information and taking the right actions.\u201d Brown\u2019s decision to host a live event came from his desire to create a more \u201ccommunity-focused\u201d episode of the show, and to help raise money for Enactus. Tickets are available for a minimum donation of $1 to the Enactus team, though attendees are free to donate more. The proceeds will help support the development of sustainable student-run businesses. The panel was the same day as the Enactus Fall Collaboration Summit. Enactus students from 20 colleges across the Southeast\u00a0were on campus learning best practices to enhance their teams\u2019 success and participating in a career fair featuring top regional employers. The Your Visionary Leadership Panel served as a bookend to that event. \u201cThe summit brings together like-minded students to hone their leadership skills and exchange best practice ideas,\u201d says Enactus team faculty advisor Dennis Loubiere. \u201cThe summit and the panel reinforce the entrepreneurial spirit that most companies are looking to hire.\u201d Brown says that attendees will leave the panel with a better understanding of what\n                     kind of leader they want to someday become, as well as the kind they can be today,\n                     adding that his favorite quote from author John Maxwell illustrates his goal for the\n                     event. \"Leaders must be close enough to relate to others\" the quote says, \"but far enough\n                     ahead to motivate them.\" Kennesaw State names recipients of 2023 Alumni Awards Kennesaw State economic impact climbs to more than $2 billion in 2022 Kennesaw State University MBA Students Explore Israel's Business Landscape Coles College Professor Provides Internship Opportunities for Local High School Students Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

It was important to Paul that the symposium provide Coles College researchers with\n                     an opportunity to share ideas with their counterparts in Georgia and beyond. \u201cI wanted to use it as a way to connect better with Georgia Tech and other big players in the area from a research perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cThat definitely motivated the selection of participants.\u201d The event also promoted collaboration within Coles College. Paul partnered with the Bagwell Center for the Study of Markets and Economic Opportunity to co-host the event. The Bagwell Center invited Sanders \u2013 a recognized authority on sports economics \u2013 and Skaperdas \u2013 director of UC Irvine\u2019s Center for Global Peace and Conflict Studies \u2013 to lead sessions at the symposium and to host separate presentations specifically for the Center. \n                      Dr. Timothy Mathews, executive director of the Bagwell Center, said the symposium\u2019s goals aligned closely with his Center\u2019s mission. \u201cThe research symposium provides an excellent opportunity to bring in well-established scholars to speak on important issues that influence economic outcomes,\u201d he said. In addition to faculty researchers, the symposium highlighted four research projects\n                     conducted by Kennesaw State students in the areas of cybersecurity and conflict management.\n                     Economics professor Dr. Marcus Marktanner served as faculty advisor on a project researched\n                     by Almuth Merkel, a PhD student in the School of Conflict Management. Her study examined\n                     the effect foreign aid might play on worsening political conflicts. \n                      The presence of student presenters is essential to the symposium\u2019s success, Paul said, as is inviting undergraduate students to attend the symposium and learn from the speakers. \u201cA significant component of this event is student engagement and highlighting student work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are elevating those interactions with students at a higher level.\u201d Going forward, Paul would like to see future homeland security research symposiums\n                     continue to collaborate with more researchers inside and outside Coles College. \u201cPart of what drives me to keep going back is that I\u2019m seeing a lot of work in this area not only from Coles College, but across the board,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a great event to bring all these players together and realize that we can do something bigger.\u201d Kennesaw State names recipients of 2023 Alumni Awards Kennesaw State economic impact climbs to more than $2 billion in 2022 Kennesaw State University MBA Students Explore Israel's Business Landscape Coles College Professor Provides Internship Opportunities for Local High School Students Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

August has had plenty of leadership experience since enrolling in Kennesaw State University in 2016. She is the former vice president for community service and former senior vice president of the Delta Sigma Pi business fraternity\u2019s Nu Pi chapter; and has worked as a resident assistant at the Austin Residence Complex for two years. She was also a mentor in the Odyssey Peer Mentoring program. This week, August joins 1,000 other young leaders from around the country who have\n                     been chosen as Under 30 Scholars at the Forbes Under 30 Summit in Detroit. Held at the Masonic Temple Oct. 27-30, the Under 30 Summit will connect an expected 9,000 young people \u2013 all under 30 \u2013 with other leaders, founders, and creators for a massive conference and networking event. Among the 200+ presenters are Jon Oringer, the founder of Shutterstock; Steve Case, co-founder of AOL; championship tennis player Serena Williams; and actor Olivia Munn. As an Under 30 Scholar, August receives complimentary access to all summit activities,\n                     including 20 session tracks, industry-specific field trips, a music festival, networking\n                     sessions, a community service project, and a food truck festival. Other attendees\n                     must pay nearly $600 for the same experience. In addition, she and the other scholars\n                     will attend an invitation-only dinner with major investors. \u201cI feel very accomplished to have been chosen,\u201d August says. \u201cIt feels like all the hard work I\u2019ve put in throughout my high school and college careers is actually coming to fruition.\u201d \n                      \n                   August is no stranger to hard work. As a woman of color pursuing a career in technology,\n                     she recognized early on that not everyone expects her to succeed in the male-dominated\n                     field, which has motivated her to work twice as hard. During her first year at Kennesaw State, she was director of programming for the University Village Community Council, where she worked with Housing and Residence Life as an advocate for her fellow residents. August later became a resident assistant at ARC. In that role, she has organized several social and professional events designed to improve residents\u2019 cultural competency and help them develop their personal brands. August is also active in the Delta Sigma Pi business fraternity. As the former vice\n                     president of community service, she led donation drives for hurricane victims, taught\n                     professionalism classes to at-risk youth for the Center for Children and Young Adults,\n                     and volunteered with the elderly at Grace Personal Care Home. Later, she served as\n                     senior vice president of the Nu Pi chapter, where she used strategic marketing to\n                     welcome 15 new brothers over two semesters. \u201cI feel like all of the things that I've done since I was a freshman at Kennesaw State University have been uniquely different,\u201d she says. \u201cYet they all focus on things that are important to me like personal development, leadership, community service, or technology. I was able to learn from all of these experiences and grow into what I believe I will become.\u201d August, who is pursuing a minor in marketing in addition to her IS degree, believes\n                     attending the Under 30 Summit as a scholar will help her grow her professional network\n                     and expose her to new and exciting perspectives. She has rarely traveled outside of\n                     the South and is looking forward to interacting with the other scholars and with entrepreneurs\n                     from around the country. \u201cThat is the whole point of it,\u201d she says. \u201cI have to surround myself with people that are wiser than me and who have more experience than me. I should be able to learn from them and take something different from every experience that I have.\u201d August plans to take the lessons learned at the Under 30 summit back with her as she\n                     finishes her degree and continues her work as an email marketing intern with marketing\n                     platform company Mailchimp. After graduation, she will pursue a career in project\n                     management, which she says will combine her technical knowledge, her understanding\n                     of business processes, and her interest in marketing. Most of all, she hopes to take home some new insights on leadership from the summit\n                     presenters to complement her already strong thoughts on the subject, and to provide\n                     sound advice to her younger siblings and peers. \u201cMy philosophy is that a great leader is someone who serves others and provides support, but does not compel too much control,\u201d August says. \u201cI believe that a leader should receive input from the whole team. Decision making should not rely solely on one person. I aspire to be the best leader that I can be.\u201d -Patrick Harbin Kennesaw State names recipients of 2023 Alumni Awards Kennesaw State economic impact climbs to more than $2 billion in 2022 Kennesaw State University MBA Students Explore Israel's Business Landscape Coles College Professor Provides Internship Opportunities for Local High School Students Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

Folsom takes a critical, revisionist look at Roosevelt's\n                                             presidency, his economic policies, and his personal life. 9/26, 10/3, 10/10, 10/17 Meeting time: 3:30pm-4:45pm Location: Kennesaw Campus Did World War II really end the Great Depression\u2014or did President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s poor judgment and confused management leave Congress with a devastating fiscal mess after the final bomb was dropped? In this provocative new book, historians Burton W. Folsom, Jr., and Anita Folsom make a compelling case that FDR\u2019s presidency led to evasive and self-serving wartime policies. \u00a0 Apply Now You can contact   with questions about future reading groups. \u00a0 Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

These investments are primarily motivated by\n                                       a combination of foreign policy objectives and economic interests, which include securing\n                                       access to natural resources, markets, and investment opportunities. Despite this,\n                                       the influence of foreign policy initiatives on Chinese investment in Africa has been\n                                       under-explored in academic research and public discourse. This research article will examine the political dynamics of Chinese investments in\n                                       Africa and investigate how Chinese foreign policy influences its investment decisions\n                                       in Africa. It will do so by understanding the historical context of China's engagement\n                                       with Africa and how this relationship has evolved. Lastly, it will examine the impact\n                                       of these policies on sustaining China's rapid economic growth by providing a relief\n                                       valve for the Chinese labor force and raw materials for increased production rates. The Returns from a Bachelor's Degree: R1 vs Non-R1 Universities Parth Pisolkar In today\u2019s competitive job market, a bachelor\u2019s degree has become a minimum requirement for many entry-level positions. However, according to College Board, from 2009- 2019, the average tuition and fees at a public four-year institutionhas increased by 24% (adjusted for inflation), whereas real GDP per capita hasgone up by only 15%(Source: St. Louis Fred). With the risingcost of tuition, many students face a difficult decision when selecting a college: Should they attend a top school that boasts a strong reputation or attend one with more affordable tuition fees? This question has become increasingly relevant as more employers place a premium on the prestige of a top institution from which a candidate has graduated. While a bachelor\u2019s degree from a top school may offer greater opportunities and earning potential, a degree from a less prestigious school often provides amore affordable option. In this paper, we will explore how going to a top tier school affects the student\u2019s overall quality of life by looking at their movement within the country aftergraduation. The Influences of Genetic Engineering within Kenya's Agricultural Sector Yvonne Thuo This paper relates how advanced biotechnology can influence Kenya\u2019s agricultural sector to the benefit of its economy. With another severe drought affecting Kenya\u2019s crops, a new method of growing crops must be administered. Research involving genetically modified organisms (GMOs) supports that the usage of genetic engineering may be Kenya\u2019s best option for increasing agricultural output. With other countries utilizing GMOs for agricultural practices, Kenya can adopt the technology and produce crops despite drought conditions. Effects on Trade Sophistication: Vietnam-Korea FTA Duc Nguyen This paper studies the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between South Korea and Vietnam,\n                                       which entered into force in December of 2015. We study the change in trade relationships\n                                       between these nations, focusing on the levels of exports and imports between them\n                                       and also their Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The data on bilateral trade between these\n                                       two countries are gathered from the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) database\n                                       covering the period of 2010-2020. We also used the UNCTAD and WTO databases to obtain\n                                       necessary statistics on GDP, exchange rates and FTA, to conduct the data analysis,\n                                       we use the vector autoregressive function (VAR) test and conduct Granger causality\n                                       test on its basis to estimate short-term effects of FTA on bilateral trade between\n                                       these countries. Then, we explore the properties of the Impulse-Response function\n                                       test to estimate long-term impact of FTA on trade. As the data show, the effects of\n                                       FTA on Vietnamese exports were significant in the medium term. Whilst the agreement\n                                       has had a larger effect in the long term on Vietnamese imports from Korea, the results\n                                       do show that it is worthwhile for both Korea and Vietnam to re-examine the agreement\n                                       and either revise the document to reflect modern needs or enact policies to encourage\n                                       trade between both nations. The outcomes of the agreement were similar to those of\n                                       NAFTA. Deceptive Advertising in Video Games Justin Schymanski As of 2021, the market size of the video games industry has reached a figure of more than $110 billion. On top of this, the total revenue of streaming services in the video game industry reached $78 million in 2021. The data compiled by IBISWorld shows that the given figures have grown over the past decade and are predicted to continue growing, as shown in Figure 1. The growth of the video game industry and the increasing size of the streaming industry lead to the possibility that the industry could greatly impact people\u2019s financial decisions, given its size and power. Therefore, it is important to understand how consumers\u2019 decisions are affecting the market so that they can make better financial decisions. In order to understand consumers\u2019 decisions, the first step would be to analyze previous instances of companies abusing advertising strategies, such as those through streaming services, which unethically influence consumers\u2019 decisions to invest money or not invest money in their product. Ticketmaster's Dominance and (Theoretical) Innocence Noah B. Walton The model of dynamic price systems is used by companies to inflate and reduce the prices in response to market conditions. Many large firms use dynamic pricing to manage revenue and maximize profit. Ticketmaster, an international superpower in the live-event ticket sales industry, uses the dynamic pricing model to create profit while accounting for consumer preferences and willingness to pay for a product. Ticketmaster\u2019s dynamic pricing model helps ensure that goods are more likely to get purchased by the person with the highest value for the good, which is desirable for those consumers with a high reservation price and beneficial for economic efficiency. Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing model accounts for numerous factors, including popularity of the event, concert venue characteristics (e.g., location, size), and day of event. Ticket prices fluctuate continually using a system of algorithms and inputs that are designed to observe and analyze multiple variables such as live ticket sales, previous sale data, and customer reactivity. Critics believe that Ticketmaster's pricing models cause higher ticket prices for more desired, mainstream events, making it impossible for an average customer to purchase without spending hundreds to thousands of dollars. Despite the popular opinion, Ticketmaster's model has worked well for maximizing profits and keeping its top-grade position in the system. This system, despite many public opinions, has also provided high-level access to ticket accessibility and is generally regarded as a very well-structured ticketing system. Ticketmaster has also acquired many companies and receives funding from others to maintain near-monopolization status over the entertainment ticketing industry. This study will cover Ticketmaster\u2019s dynamic pricing model in the ticket sales market and how that model has impacted the public\u2019s access to live performance. 2021-2022 \u00a0 The Supply and Demand of Models in Economics: Models as a Tool for Reasoning and a\n                                 Tool to Justify the Status Quo Trish Weber There are two kinds of economist: the student and the engineer. They approach economics\n                                       with different presuppositions, and each has a different goal in mind. Their sole\n                                       commonality is that they call themselves economists. Both present themselves as working\n                                       under the umbrella of economic science. This creates confusion. Science, as a term,\n                                       has a very narrow and specific meaning: Science is concerned with empiric measurements.\n                                       Only the student economist stays true to this definition; he measures and observes.\n                                       The engineer economist, on the other hand, uses the principles of economics science\n                                       and wants to either persuade or to apply principles of the science to change how the\n                                       economy works. The Impact of Socialism on Practicing Economics Systems Nathaneal Cook This paper will explore the effects of socialism on the Russian economy. It will contrast socialistic ideologies and practices with capitalistic ideologies and practices. The research will inform the reader of the origins of socialism and provide a case study into the economic impact of socialism on those that have chosen to adopt its\u2019 customs and practices. The research will look to answer the question: \u201cdoes history prove that socialism is an effective economic system?\u201d The paper will exhort the reader to evaluate lessons from history in a manner that provokes thought and causes reflection. Ultimately, the reader will be able to clearly discern the lessons that history teaches about the effects of socialism on an economy. COVID-19\u2019s Impact on the U.S. Economy and the Government\u2019s Policy Response Elijah James This research will examine how the United States has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic from a macroeconomic perspective and the government\u2019s policy response undertaken to mitigate the damage. We will attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of some of the federal government and the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy decisions. At the beginning of the pandemic, the economy shut down, having a daunting effect on Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In addition, unemployment skyrocketed as people left the workforce and delayed returning. Data for this research has been gathered from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), St. Louis and Dallas Federal Reserve, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The Impact of Democracy vs. Autocracy on Environmental Degradation\u00a0 Terrilynn Melton and Marcus Marktanner We examine the impact of democracy and autocracy on environmental degradation, hypothesizing that an authoritarian regime needs to be less responsive to citizens\u2019 needs to internalize the social costs associated with the extraction of natural resources than democracies. If the government maximizes profits from natural resources extraction, meaning that it acts like a monopolist, then the following emerges. Authoritarian regimes will extract more resources and impose higher social costs on their citizens than democracies. Implicit to this result is that the level of natural resource extraction might be closer to the social optimum in an autocracy than in a democracy. We test our hypothesis using simple OLS regression. Our dependent variables are CO2 emissions, natural resource depletion, natural resource rents, air pollution, as well as the number of deaths related to air pollution. Our focus independent variable is a political regime indicator. We control for GDP per capita and population density, as well as regional fixed effects. Our findings lend strong support to our hypothesis that, all else equal, autocracies extract more resources and impose higher social costs on society than democracies who internalize more of the social cost resulting in the extraction of less resources. The Impact of COVID-19 on the Real Estate Market of Atlanta and Other Major Cities Parth Pisolkar Real Estate markets are one of the major indicators of how an economy (micro or macro)\n                                       is performing. Nearly 5.8 million houses were sold in the US in May 2021 alone, which\n                                       is a tremendous increase of over 44% from the previous year. Real Estate is considered\n                                       one of the most stable markets in the US as it is one of the least liquifiable asset\n                                       class. It is a fixed income asset class which provides reliable income for many investors\n                                       which is why there is a sense of trust among people when purchasing real estate. This\n                                       trust can depend on a lot of factors such as Government Policies (monetary and fiscal\n                                       policy), Prospects of FDI (Foreign Direct Investment), DII (Domestic Institutional\n                                       Investment), etc. When people are willing to invest/buy real estate, it means there\n                                       has been (or is going on) an increase in savings, earnings, and income of households\n                                       in a particular geographical/political area. 2020-2021 \u00a0 Marketing's Impact on the Music Industry Andrew Hughes In recent decades the complexity of modern popular music has consistently declined. This paper seeks to explain the economic impact marketing has had on music itself, as well as the industry it occupies. The increased ease with which artists can market themselves through social media platforms has led to a detriment in the quality of music being produced today. As a result, an artists\u2019 success is now less dependent upon skill. Rather, prospects for success are increasingly about consistent output, and how the artist promotes themselves. Music streaming platforms have contributed to the degradation of musical originality in recent years, favoring artists who are consistently creating good work over those interested in creating great work that will stand the test of time. The Use of Markets as a Tool for Upward Mobility and Generational Wealth Amitai Ilan This paper will explore how financial markets and investment products can build generational wealth for members of society. The research will answer the question: \u201ccan anyone, regardless of initial income, use the financial markets to build and preserve generational wealth and, if so, how can they best utilize it to do so?\u201d It will provide examples to fully show how workers of varying income levels and of different ages can build and preserve accumulated wealth in retirement. This will be done by looking at different case studies with various incomes, compounding interest, and back tested invested principles. It will also touch on what prevents people from doing this effectively, as well as flaws in our current system. The paper will also focus on preserving wealth in retirement, and other alternatives if not enough wealth was generated to do this, or peace of mind is a factor. While this topic is often touched on in other papers, the discussion rarely contains information on an indefinite time, the use of cash, or other various alternatives. Vaccine Companies and their Relations to the Market Trends Matthew Tesvich The goal of this study is to find trends amongst vaccination companies and their roles played throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We have collected over a year\u2019s worth of data, September 2019 through December 2020, providing entries across the stocks: Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PZE), AstraZeneca (AZN), Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings (ARCT), BioNTech (BNTX). We are able to clearly see similar patterns across the stock charts while cross comparing the data. It is clear that there are certain indicators that are firing off that lead to spikes in the data charts. The spikes in the industry can also lead to spikes in other companies, leading us to further analyze why that may be happening. Furthermore, we are analyzing why the stock prices are reacting the way that they are. There are cases that one vaccination may take off or fall hard while the rest of the market holds steady. This could indicate flaws with the product, company, bad press, etc. By discovery of a pattern, we can identify market leaders and correlations for the future. Patterns also allow us to better understand indicators and why they fired off the way that they did. To sum up everything that has been stated thus far, data analysis allows us to see things that the naked eye cannot identify. Throughout this study, we are able to use data to see things that we could not see by merely looking at the charts. This creates the ability to dive deeper into the datasets and come to conclusions as to why something may be happening. 2019-2020 \u00a0 Georgia's Journey to Full Employment Ryan Wilson In many developing economies around the world, the problem of inclusive growth continues to elude economic developers and policymakers alike. A key issue within the inclusive growth model that seems to have lost momentum with policymakers is the concept of full employment as described in the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The UN\u2019s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 23, specifically states the following: \u00a0 The Intersection of Crime and Technology on Education Antoine Jackson This paper will explore the intersection of technology and education on crime and\n                                       employment. The research will inform policymakers about the costs and benefits of\n                                       technology centers and research parks and reveal how promotion of education and technology\n                                       affect the decision-making processes of crime and employment. This will be done by\n                                       looking at crime and education around technology and research parks and their benefits,\n                                       both locally and nationwide. A local perspective is important because many of these\n                                       parks are in high population areas and are more likely to experience higher rates\n                                       of crime. A national perspective is important because the parks provide incentives\n                                       for people to migrate and gravitate towards them. What's the Deal with Drum Corps International Scoring? Matthew McKenzie The Drum Corps International (DCI) is an organization for drum and bugle corps based out of Indiana. They are liable for developing rules and providing standardized adjudication at DCI sanctioned competitions all throughout the USA and Canada with the goal of crowning a world championship corps at the end of the season. We question whether some categories of scoring are more important than explicitly listed. Specifically, although there are three main scoring categories that account for 40, 30, and 30 points to add up to a possible 100 points total for each team, the two categories with lower point potentials display higher variations in the magnitude of score differential when judges in those categories do not agree with a team\u2019s overall rank. This suggests that if judges do not agree with the rankings of teams by judges in other categories, they may skew the amount of points they award teams within their category to impact the final ranking. Overview of the Clean Water Act and Its Economic Ramifications Morgan Pace The Clean Water Act originated within the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) amendments of 1972 (Bell et al). The impetus for the creation of the Clean Water Act was the Cuyahoga River which repeatedly caught fire as a result of the severe water pollution in the river (\u201cCuyahoga River Fire\u201d). The initial goal of the Clean Water Act was to \u201celiminate all discharges of pollutants in the nation\u2019s waterways by 1985\u201d (Salzman & Thompson). The United States government has since spent over $1 trillion to contain and eliminate water pollution. Geopolitical Summits and Market Volatility Nicholas Fulton We provide evidence of a negative relationship between short-term market volatility\n                                       and geopolitical summit meetings. More specifically, our results show a significant\n                                       decrease in the VIX volatility index for days surrounding geopolitical events such\n                                       as G7 or G20 meetings. Though the decrease in volatility is short-lived, this finding\n                                       may be surprising given the nature of these events as well-known, publicized meetings\n                                       that are primarily focused on long-term goals. A Comparison of NBA and WNBA Player Salaries Elle Baker This paper compares player base salaries in the NBA and WNBA (the premier male and\n                                       female U.S. professional basketball leagues respectively). Unsurprisingly, average\n                                       salaries in the NBA ($8,264,922) and considerably higher than average salaries in\n                                       the WNBA ($73,738). Thinking about intra-league salary inequality, Gini Coefficients\n                                       are computed for both the NBA (0.5434) and WNBA (0.2462). Thus, while WNBA salaries\n                                       are much lower than NBA salaries, WNBA salaries are distributed much more equally\n                                       than are NBA salaries. Following these observations, there is a discussion as to what\n                                       contributes to the difference in salary levels and distributions between the two leagues. 2018-2019 \u00a0 \n                                 U.S. Car Manufacturers Survival in New Trading Grounds\n                                  Steven Rodriguez Martinez The text explores reasons why Ford and GM voluntarily increased their operations in China, and how policies of the Trump administration are affecting the U.S. automobile industry with its attempts to force Ford and GM to bring some of those investments back to the U.S. Policies enacted under President Trump have been successful in forcing Ford and GM to invest more in the U.S.; however, because of other hurtful government decisions and these companies\u2019 (Ford and GM) previous actions of increasing their presence in China, Trump\u2019s approach will lead to an increase in the companies\u2019 costs and potentially make them vulnerable to future financial struggles. U.S. Clean Carbon Costs: An Investigation of Georgia Markets and Solar Technology Carnell Tate This paper investigates how geographical variations affect energy costs throughout\n                                       the United States by using a Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) model. The objective\n                                       was to deconstruct a nationwide LCOE model and investigate the assumptions that are\n                                       made on a state level; in this case, Georgia was the chosen sample to exhibit how\n                                       challenges in solar technology affect the cost of clean carbon energy. 2017-2018 \u00a0 A Study of the Macro Economic Effects on the Cocaine Market in New York Robbie Skinner This paper examines the impact of macroeconomic variables and other factors that in\n                                       uence the price of cocaine in New York using the Drug Enforcement Agency's System\n                                       to Retrieve Information on Drug Evidence (STRIDE) dataset. Results suggest macroeconomic\n                                       factors have varying effects on price and offer support for the \"Expected Purity Hypothesis\"\n                                       proposed by past researchers. Measuring Economic Freedom \u2013 an Alternative Functional Specification and Subsequent Ranking Sean Balliew and Timothy Mathews The Fraser Institute\u2019s \u201cEconomic Freedom of the World\u201d index provides an aggregate measure of economic freedom by taking a simple arithmetic mean of scores over five subdimensions: (1) size of government, (2) legal structure and security of property rights, (3) access to sound money, (4) freedom to trade internationally, and (5) regulation of credit, labor, and business. By computing the aggregate score as a simple arithmetic mean, it is implicitly assumed that the different sub-dimensions are \u201cperfect substitutes\u201d for each other. As an alternative, we compute an aggregate economic freedom score, and resulting ordinal ranking, by taking a geometric mean of the five sub-dimensions. For this alternative specification, the marginal impact of each sub-dimension on the aggregate score is no longer independent of the other sub-dimension scores. Consequently, countries with inconsistent levels of economic freedom across subdimensions are \u201cpunished\u201d to a greater degree than are countries with less variability across the sub-dimensions. For the ordinal ranking of countries which results from this alternate approach, 9 countries moved up 8 or more spots and 9 countries moved down 10 or more spots in the ranking. When ordered using a geometric mean instead of arithmetic mean, Qatar realizes the largest upward movement in the ranking (ranked 36th instead of 46th), while Sweden realizes the largest downward movement in the ranking (ranked 46th instead of 27th). Finally, we show that our alternative measure of economic freedom correlates with Per Capita GDP slightly more strongly than does the standard measure computed by the Frasier Institute. A Time Series Analysis of Crypto Currency Price Data Dave Hagemann Crypto currency markets have recently become more and more popular, but are clearly in their infancy relative to developed financial markets. Using prices series data gathered using web-scraping techniques on the more well-known coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as an \"alt\" coin called Monero, I first test these time series to determine whether or not they are stationary using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, and as is usual with price data, find that they are not. After detrending the data, then investigate whether there are any Granger causality relationships between the different price series, and comment on whether this suggests anything about the state of the Efficient\u00a0Market Hypothesis in this relatively young financial market. \u00a0 Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

Summer 2022 \u00a0 The Economics of Stadium Subsidies: A Policy Retrospective  (Professor of Economics, Bagwell Center Affiliated Faculty Member) Dennis Coates Brad R. Humphreys This article is intended to inform public policy regarding stadium subsidies, which\n                                       state and local governments routinely provide to support professional sports teams.\n                                       We review theoretical and empirical evidence regarding economic justifications for\n                                       public funding, focusing on recent re- search and contemporary development strategies, which continue to demonstrate that\n                                       stadiums are poor public investments. Our analysis includes a history of US major-league\n                                       professional sports stadiums, documenting trends in building and funding, which portend\n                                       a forthcoming wave of new costly stadium construction. Despite robust contrary evidence\n                                       that stadiums are not economic development catalysts, public outlays persist and exhibit\n                                       a positive growth trajectory. We examine reasons for the disconnect between research\n                                       and policy, which includes political and institutional factors not previously given\n                                       due consideration by economists.

Corruption and Stock Market Development: Developing vs. Developed Economies\u00a0 Md Shahedur R. Chowdhury Maroula Khraiche James W. Boudreau (Associate Professor of Economics, Bagwell Center Affiliated Faculty\n                                       Member) \" \" This paper looks at the impact of corruption on stock market development, emphasizing the difference between developing and developed economies and the role corruption may play in preventing firms from listing. After setting up a theoretical model that explains why corruption\u2019s impact on stock market development may differ, we use a sample of 87 economies worldwide over the period 1995\u20132017 to test its hypotheses. For the full sample we find no evidence that corruption has a significant effect on stock market development, but this changes when we split the sample into two groups: high-income and low income countries. For the subsample of poorer (developing) countries, the corruption-stock market development relationship remains insignificant or weak. For the subsample of high-income (developed) countries, however, we find a significant relationship between lower levels of corruption and stock market capitalization as a share of gross domestic product. Our results further indicate that higher levels of income and investment reduce the impact of that aforementioned relationship, suggesting a form of diminishing returns, but this is in line with our theoretical model\u2019s results. Our results are robust to alternative estimation specifications and confirm the importance of macroeconomic fundamentals (i.e., income, investment, domestic credit, and macroeconomic stability) for the development of stock markets. In particular, those fundamentals seem more important for developing economies before reduced corruption will have as much (if any) of an impact.

The tax cuts stimulate persistently business\n                                       investment and output, but the size of the effects is rather small. Other tax policy\n                                       tools, such as increases in depreciation allowances and investment tax credits, are\n                                       more efficient at stimulating investment. Debt financing, the tax treatment of investment,\n                                       and the persistence of the tax cuts play crucial roles for the estimates. The Impact of RTAs on Trade in Indonesia Gohar Samvel Sedrakyan, Part-Time Assistant Professor of Economics, Bagwell Center\n                                       Affiliated Faculty \" \" We use the case of Indonesia to answer the question if signing regional trade agreements (RTAs) should be expected to serve as a direct tool to increase the level of bilateral trade between the signatories. We study the impact of RTAs on change in imports and exports between Indonesia and forty-two other countries, and use two gravity models - exports and imports - of trade to conduct the analysis. Four different measures of RTAs are included to reflect the agreements that Indonesia had used in conducting its international trade from 1989 to 2019. This strategy allows us to determine the cases of trade creation, diversion and contraction due to each of those agreements. To support the findings associated with the aggregate analysis of exports and imports, nine product groups are introduced and the same strategies are applied, which test the basis of our findings disaggregated by products. The Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood technique is used to run the econometric analysis. The study estimates that the exports from Indonesia do not utilize the benefits available to this country through the ASEAN free trade area (AFTA). Whereas, the AFTA is a significant driver of imports to the large Indonesian market, which are higher by $702,000 for these partners. It was assessed that the ASEAN Plus format of free trade agreements has a significant negative impact on exports from Indonesia and contracts it by $273,000. It leads to a combination of consequences, which include a significant contraction of some of the exports and a diversion of the share of exports to the countries that build their cooperation on partial scope agreements with Indonesia. In contrast, the ASEAN Plus trade partners exploit the full potential of the Indonesian market for their imports, which rise, on average, by $352,000. The most balanced and beneficial form of integration for Indonesia is the partnerships set forth in the form of partial scope agreements (PSA). Not having a regional trade agreement with Indonesia has a negative impact on bilateral trade of this country, which, reduces exports by $452,000 and imports by $65,000. The balanced trade is also determined with the WTO member countries. The recommendation is to define the comparative advantages that would turn around and lead to the gains from trade within the ASEAN Plus and AFTA partnerships. The PSAs seem to be a better fit for the trade objectives of Indonesia, therefore expanding the list of PSA partnerships would benefit this country\u2019s trade. The product level analysis of trade supports our findings that were generated on the aggregate level. Summer 2021 \u00a0 Inframarginal Externalities:\u00a0COVID-19, Vaccines, and Universal Mandates Brian C. Albrecht, Assistant Professor of Economics, Bagwell Center Affiliated Faculty Shruti Rajagopalan, Senior Research Fellow, Mercatus Center at George Mason University,\n                                       and Fellow, NYU School of Law \" \" SARS-CoV-2 (commonly called COVID-19) vaccine mandates are in place or being debated across the world. Standard neoclassical economics argues that the marginal\n                                       social benefit from vaccination exceeds the marginal private benefit; everyone vaccinated\n                                       against a given infectious disease protects themselves and protects others by not\n                                       transmitting the disease. Consequently, private levels of vaccination will be lower\n                                       than the socially optimal levels due to underconsumption/free-rider problems, requiring\n                                       mandates to overcome the problem. We that the economic argument for mandates is less\n                                       compelling for COVID-19. First, most of the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine are internalized, vaccinated individuals are protected from the\n                                       worst effects of the disease and may even exclude others from the benefits of the vaccine by transmitting\n                                       the infection. Therefore, the externality may be inframarginal or policy irrelevant. Even\n                                       when all the benefits are not internalized to the individual, the externalities are mainly local,\n                                       even in a global pandemic, therefore requiring local institutional (private and civil society) arrangements\n                                       to boost vaccine rates. We find that the economic case for universal vaccine mandates, based\n                                       on externality and free-riding, is weak in the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, and that economists\n                                       and politicians must justify such vaccine mandates on some other basis.

The WMW test is a \u00a0primary nonparametric statistical test in FDA drug product evaluation and other prominent medical settings. Using computational nonparametric statistical methods, we also establish the relative frequency with which paradox-generating Simpson Reversals occur under RSS \u00a0when an initial data sequence is pooled with its ordinal replicate. For each 2-sample, n-element per sample or 2 x n case of RSS considered, strict Reversals occurred for between 0% and 1.74% of data poolings across the whole sample space, roughly similar to that observed for 2 x 2 x 2 contingency tables and considerably less than that observed for path models. The Reversal rate conditional on observed initial sequence is highly variable. Despite a mode at 0%, this rate exceeds 20% for some initial \u00a0sequences. Our empirical application identifies clusters of Simpson Reversal susceptibility for publicly-released mobile phone radiofrequency exposure data. Simpson Reversals under RSS are not simply a theoretical concern but can reverse nonparametric or parametric biostatistical results even in vitally important public health settings. Conceptually, Paradox incidence can be viewed as a robustness check on a given WMW statistical test result. When an instance of Paradox occurs, results constituting this instance are found to be data-scale dependent. Given that the rate of Reversal can vary substantially by initial sequence, the practice of calculating this rate conditional on observed initial sequence represents a potentially important robustness check upon a result. When Does Economic Freedom promote Equitable Social Development? , Associate Professor of Economics, Bagwell Center Affiliated Faculty Member Almuth Merkel \" \" Why do some countries successfully combine economic freedom with equitable social development while others fail to do so? We focus on three sectors in which government is supposed to play a strong role according to the history of economic thought. These are health, education, and social safety. Yet, identifying the exact role of government in these sectors \u2013 either through the provision of public goods or the regulation of markets - is difficult. Necessary data is often not available or comparable. We therefore suggest focusing on revealed policy strengths. This approach rests on the assumption that higher incomes, all else equal, allow for better public health, higher human capital, and improved social safety. Thus, when two countries have the same income per capita, but one country performs better in any of our three focus sectors, then, we conclude, the better performing country must reveal a relative policy strength in that sector. Our findings suggest that countries with greater revealed policy strengths in public health, human capital and, social safety are more effective in combining market freedom with equitable social development.

This analysis focuses on twenty-seven transition economies\n                                       of the Former Soviet Union, and Central and Eastern Europe. We use gravity models\n                                       to assess the impact of sanctions for the period from 2014 to 2019. Using Poisson\n                                       pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) econometric technique, we show that emigration from\n                                       transition economies to Russia declined as a result of imposed Western and US sanctions.\n                                       We also estimate that the sanctions significantly contracted the flow of remittances\n                                       to transition economies from Russia. A 1% increase in Western/US sanctions resulted\n                                       in the decline of emigration by 11/9 individuals and of remittances to transition\n                                       economies by $0.014/0.01 million.

Though some studies have identified positive neighborhood effects from stadiums on nearby residential property, scant research exists on highly-localized commercial activity that is hypothesized to spur development. This analysis exploits the recent relocation of a professional baseball team from downtown Atlanta to a pre-existing Georgia Business Improvement District (Community Improvement District or CID) in suburban Cobb County to estimate the impact of the stadium development on commercial property values. The existence of multiple CIDs in the metro-Atlanta area provides the opportunity to estimate a counterfactual comparison absent the stadium to draw causal inference regarding the stadium\u2019s impact on economic activity using the synthetic control method. Estimates indicate that the stadium decreased commercial property values in the district, which is consistent with past studies that find little to no positive impact on economic activity. The results indicate that previous findings of positive impacts on residential property may not be applicable to commercial activity.

The paradox was first put forth by Yule (1903) and later developed by Simspon (1951). While first considered strictly for the domain of parametric testing, its presence in non-parametric statistical results has recently been studied (Haunsperger, 2003; Haunsperger and Saari ,1991; Bargagliotti, 2009). Of particular importance to the present study, Haunsperger and Saari (1991) find conditions for\u00a0Simpson reversals\u00a0in rank sum statistical testing, where the term\u00a0Simpson reversal\u00a0is used synonymously with the term\u00a0instances of Simpson\u2019s Aggregation Paradox\u00a0herein. In general, the paradox has been found to affect statistical results in many important scientific domains, including environmental and related ecological research (see, e.g., Pineiro et al., 2006 or Allison and Goldberg, 2002). In studying global temperature over time, Foster and Rahmstorf (2011) note that the scale of data (time scale of study) can influence the statistical results of a study, for example.

The classic arguments against central planning, put forward by Ludwig\n                                       von Mises and F.A.

Tax policy \u2013 is it a better alternative to patent policy? , Professor of Economics, Bagwell Center Affiliated Faculty Member \" \" It is believed that if there is no informational asymmetry between the firms and the government, firms could be remunerated for innovation using optimal taxation rather than patents. We show that under reasonable conditions (such as the government\u2019s inability to customize the tax rate for each firm), patent protection is preferable than a tax/subsidy scheme if the marginal costs of the imitators are sufficiently higher than that of the innovator. Production inefficiency created by imitation is the reason for our result. If the marginal costs of the imitators are similar to that of the innovator, the authority can choose an appropriate patent breadth to replicate the outcome of the tax/subsidy scheme.

If benefits\n                                       accrue only to the few states offering the greatest incentives, then the impact might\n                                       not be evident through interstate comparisons. This study uses the synthetic control\n                                       method to examine the economic impact of relatively large film tax credit and grant\n                                       subsidies offered by Georgia and North Carolina. Both states experienced lower per\n                                       capita income than expected after implementing film incentives, indicating that economic\n                                       benefits did not accrue to the winners of this economic incentives arms race. Skill Mismatch of Indigenous Peoples in Canada: Findings from PIAAC\u00a0 , Lecturer, Department of Economics, Central Michigan University \" \" Using the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (Canadian\n                                       sample) the paper examines overskilling among Indigenous off-reserve peoples and compares\n                                       the outcomes to the other Canadian born. We construct several measures of skill mismatch\n                                       in literacy and numeracy finding no statistically significant difference between aboriginal\n                                       and non-aboriginal Canadian-born populations. We then use the developed measures in\n                                       the analysis of wages and find that among First Nations, Metis and Inuit only the\n                                       males of the former aboriginal group earn significantly less than their non-aboriginal\n                                       Canadian-born counterparts. Summer 2018 \u00a0 A Knife-Point Case for Sion and Wolfe\u2019s Game James Boudreau, Assistant Professor of Economics, Bagwell Center Affiliated Faculty\n                                       Member \u201c \u201d Sion and Wolfe\u2019s (1957) game is relatively well-known in the game theory literature for possessing almost of all of the properties sufficient for the existence of Nash equilibrium, yet still lacking one. Here we make a slight but specific alteration to their game that allows for the existence of equilibria, in an effort to explore just why equilibria failed to exist in the original case. We then connect our case to several other examples in the literature to show that these games all lack equilibria because they feature what we call hiding spots, which are crucial violations of the payoff security properties that have been established as sufficient for equilibrium existence. Since identifying hiding spots in some games is quite easy, relative fully verifying other conditions, this paper therefore serves as another step toward identifying conditions for the (non-)existence of equilibria. Do Movie Production Incentives Generate Economic Development? , Professor of Economics, Bagwell Center Affiliated Faculty Member \u201c \u201d Movie production incentives (MPI) are a popular economic development strategy employed\n                                       by US states. Film subsidies are intended to encourage external investment into an\n                                       untapped industry that spills over onto complementary industries to generate economic\n                                       growth through a multiplier. Despite their widespread use, the positive impact of\n                                       MPIs on state economies has not been documented, and several states have halted MPI\n                                       programs due to high costs and questionable efficacy. This study exploits the staggered\n                                       implementation, suspension, and elimination of film incentive programs across states\n                                       to estimate the macroeconomic impact of MPIs. Instrumental variable estimates that\n                                       permit causal inference do not support the hypothesized positive impacts of film incentives\n                                       on state economies.

But is that what\n                                       America is about?

Beneath our feet, Uranium atoms in the Earth\u2019s crust hold incredibly concentrated energy. Science unlocked this energy in the mid-20th century, first for bombs and then to power submarines. The United States led the effort to generate electricity from this new source. Yet in the mid-20th century as societies began the transition to nuclear power and away from fossil fuels, a long-term PR campaign to scare the public began, funded in part by coal and oil interests. This campaign would sow fear about harmless low-level radiation and create confusion between nuclear weapons and nuclear energy. Looking squarely at the problem, Oliver Stone shows us that knowledge is the antidote to fear, and our human ingenuity will allow us to solve the climate change crisis if we use it.

An extension will be based on the viability of securing long-term housing within an additional 14-day cycle, as well as upon the student\u2019s noticeable commitment to continually working with the CARE Services case management team to seek and utilize campus and area resources. If awarded an extension, the student will need to complete an additional Visiting Student Housing Agreement for that 14-day cycle.

KSU will provide administrative oversight for the Coordinator for the Priority Model.\u00a0 Campus Awareness, Resource & Empowerment (CARE) Services is a front runner for universities across the nation, offering services to students who are homeless, food insecure, or have experienced the foster care system. CARE Services comprehensively and strategically supports students on campus and will continue to support the Priority Model. Although more and more universities are beginning to address these issues, CARE Services is still one of the first to do so, and the services offered makes the program one for the most comprehensive in the county.\u00a0 Due to the services already provided by KSU CARE Services, the Priority Model has\n                                       a solid foundation to ensure its capacity to fulfill the role of serving Priority\n                                       Model Students. Technical College Systems of Georgia (TCSG) Priority Students are exposed to an early access to college and career exploration through the programs and trades available\u00a0to them at TCSG. Through this partnership, we are able to provide Priority Students with the resources they need to participate in Dual Enrollment and earn college credit while in high school. These students are able to take this time to learn a trade or jump start their college experience, and leave with college credits they can transfer to their four year college or university upon graduating high school. Georgia Student Finance Commission(GSFC) The mission of the Georgia Student Finance Commission is to promote and increase access to education beyond high school for Georgians.\u00a0 GSFC partners with high schools, colleges and community organizations to conduct events that include general and state financial aid information meetings, FAFSA Completion assistance, college fairs and more. The GSFC Outreach Team provides in-person trainings, workshops and information sessions across the state and collaborates with GEAR UP Georgia to ensure that our Priority Students are aware and able to take advantage of their services, to help\u00a0the entire family\u00a0plan for college.\u00a0 GSFC works\u00a0with GEAR UP Georgia\u00a0to provide this FREE service to help students and their families complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the federal application for financial aid (grants, work-study and loans) to pay for college. Priority Students are able to learn what documentation is needed, how to get started and what happens once they\u2019ve submitted the application. The Scholarship Academy The Scholarship Academy (TSA) is a comprehensive, scholarship preparatory program\n                                       that teaches low-income and Priority Students, first generation college students to\n                                       navigate the maze of financial aid in order to fund their college education. Founded by Howard University graduate Jessica Johnson, TSA specializes in breaking down the scholarship process into realistic terms for\u00a0all students. Johnson is well-versed in navigating the financial aid system, having received more than $200,000 in scholarships herself. Priority Students learn to negotiate their own financial aid packages, manage and prepare for tuition increases and independently navigate the scholarship pool.\u00a0 The goal of Scholarship Academy isn\u2019t just to get students to college financially, but empower them with the tools needed to stay there. Our students are equipped with the skills needed to reduce debt throughout school, increasing the likelihood of graduation.

The purpose of the Hybrid Schools Project is to document and analyze the variety of independent actors who are creating these new forms of K-12 schooling outside of the conventional education system. The project explores the many ways individuals and small groups are finding different ways to serve families\u2019 and students\u2019 diverse needs. Over time, the project will produce unique datasets and analyses for publication. The Hybrid Schools Project will also act as a convener to bring together hybrid and microschool founders, educators, policymakers, and researchers interested in these school models. Hybrid Schools and Microschools In their most common form these schools operate 2-3 days per week in brick and mortar buildings, with classes of students, teachers who assign work, etc. The balance of the week, these students are homeschooled. (Individual schools might offer classes in other weekly formats, such a four half days per week, for example, or give students the flexibility to come an amount up to four days per week). The defining characteristics of these schools are that most or all of the curriculum is decided by the school, students attend live classes a few days per week in a physical building, and are \u201chomeschooled\u201d the rest of the week.

(Individual schools might offer classes in other weekly formats, such a four half days per week, for example, or give students the flexibility to come an amount up to four days per week).

Since our founding in 1987, we have emphasized that family businesses should not be run like their non family-owned counterparts. This is largely due to the fact that family businesses have many unique qualities that, when properly leveraged, can lead to extraordinary performance. Consequently, our programs often are different than traditional business classes to emphasize the unique conditions inherent in family enterprise. Educational programs are typically offered in a customized format for family businesses, professional advisors, associations, and scholars. When participating in programs with the FEC, you can expect: \u00a0 \n                                  -Joe Astrachan \u00a0 Programs For Families The Mini MBA program from the Coles College of Business and the Family Enterprise\n                           Center is an innovative, experiential certificate program designed to help family\n                           enterprises flourish by equipping next-generation leaders with the tools they need\n                           to lead their businesses and family into the future. Speaker Series Throughout the year, the FEC will connect with the community through various business associations in Georgia to provide instruction by a noted speaker who will teach on various topics related to family business. \u00a0The dates are to be determined, so please connect with us below so that we can keep you informed about events in the area. Kennesaw State University (KSU) Students Do you want to have a career in business? If so, chances are high that you will eventually\n                                    work in a family enterprise. As owners and operators of 80-90% of all business in\n                                    America, entrepreneurial families are engines of economic activity. They employ close\n                                    to 60% of the American workforce and create more than 50% of our GDP. If you come from an enterprising family or are looking to one-day start a family business,\n                                    the need for specialized family enterprise education is clear. But with 35% of Fortune\n                                    500 companies and 60% of public companies owned by enterprising families, it is likely\n                                    that even those with no direct intentions will one-day work within a family organization. The bottom line? You can\u2019t afford not to learn about family businesses.

Having skipped meals almost daily without choice, she was intimately aware of the issues of hunger, food insecurity and homelessness, which the first \u201cEmpty Bowls\u201d event at Kennesaw State was designed to highlight. \u201cThere is plenty of food. It's just not getting to the right areas,\u201d she said. \u201cNearly 90,000 people in Cobb County are living food insecure, yet Americans waste 40 percent of the food we buy.\u201d As part of \u201cEmpty Bowls,\u201d an international grassroots movement, members of the Kennesaw State University campus community selected and purchased one of the handcrafted bowls at the fundraiser that was part of University's 10  annual   (HAW). \n                      \n                   In addition to Empty Bowls, the 2017 HAW includes a candlelight vigil on Friday on\n                     the Marietta campus, a sleep-out challenge for students to experience the plight of\n                     homelessness and a canned food drive at the KSU football game on Saturday. Empty Bowls brought together the  , a student ceramics club, to create the bowls, and   to prepare soup for attendees. The event was coordinated by the  .\u00a0 \u201cThe students put their hands and their hearts into making the bowls,\u201d said Marcy Stidum, founding director of KSU's  , which offers support to Kennesaw State students who have experienced homelessness,\n                     food insecurity and/or the foster care system. Empty Bowls is just one of the ways that CARE Services has partnered with groups on campus and in the community to raise awareness. Kroger, United Way and the Cobb Collaborative have also joined together with KSU CARE to promote and support the University\u2019s Homelessness Awareness Week activities and the work of KSU CARE.\u00a0 \u201cWe are always looking for unique ways to partner with organizations,\u201d Stidum said. CARE Services works with nearly 20 organizations as community partners throughout the year. Created from reclaimed clay, each of the ceramic masterpieces crafted by the KSU Mudslingers\n                     was molded by hand on the pottery wheel, called \"throwing bowls,\" and then trimmed,\n                     painted and fired in a kiln before making its way to the Empty Bowls event. \u201cThis is the first time that Kennesaw State has participated in the Empty Bowls project, a nationwide movement among the arts community,\u201d explained Jeff Campana, assistant professor of art in KSU's College of the Arts. \n                      The student organization, open to art majors and non-majors alike, involves all skill\n                     levels and gives students a chance to make art. \u201cNo other opportunity on campus allows a diverse group to come together to share a common passion for clay and having fun,\u201d said Hope Limyansky, co-president of KSU Mudslingers. To fill the Empty Bowls, University Dining prepared the noon meal using a bumper crop of 200 pounds of tomatoes from the hydroponics greenhouse at the University\u2019s Hickory Grove Farm. Executive Chef Brian Jones roasted the tomatoes, dried the leaves and ground them\n                     to garnish the soup, bringing a more garden-like flavor to the tomato-basil soup.\n                     Jones crafted the soup to utilize fresh foods and minimize waste. \n                      \n                   By participating in the Empty Bowls project, University Dining sought to bring awareness\n                     not only to issues of food insecurity and homelessness, but also to food waste and\n                     access to food. The event raised more than $1,800 for KSU CARE Services. Last year, KSU CARE Services provided food from its two food pantries \u2013 one on each campus \u2013 for almost 200 students dealing with food insecurity. \u201cWe may not realize how important food is, but students come by our pantries every day,\u201d said Stidum. Since founded in 2011, CARE Services has served or benefitted almost 550 students dealing with food insecurity and homelessness. A $12,500 donation from Kroger on Nov. 8 also will allow KSU CARE Services to fund\n                     a walk-in food pantry on the Kennesaw Campus. \n                      \n                   \u201cNormally, we just hand students a bag of food from the pantry,\u201d Stidum said. \u201cBut when students can walk in and choose foods that they like, it is empowering for them.\u201d Kroger\u2019s donation to the University and CARE Services was a perfect match, according to Felix Turner, corporate affairs manager for Kroger Atlanta. \u201cKroger was looking for different ways to partner with educational organizations in the fight against food insecurity and hunger,\u201d said Turner. \u201cKSU CARE and the food pantry is right in line with our goals.\u201d\u00a0 The company already has a plan to end hunger and waste by 2025, he added. As part of HAW\u2019s closing ceremonies tonight, Cobb Collaborative and CARE Services will jointly present a candlelight vigil and memorial service at 8 p.m. Friday, Nov. 10 at the Marietta Campus to honor those who have died while homeless in Cobb County. The event is the fourth year for the Cobb Collaborative partnership. \n                      \n                   KSU students have been encouraged to get involved and see through the eyes of someone\n                     struggling with homelessness as part of the weeklong activities. Students who accept the final HAW Sleep Out Challenge at the Marietta Campus on Friday,\n                     will stay overnight in a simulated Red Cross shelter, in their cars or outside on\n                     the ground to further understand the plight of homelessness. Attendees to Kennesaw State's football game on Saturday are also encouraged to \u201cHoot Out Hunger\u201d and bring a canned item for donation to the University's food pantries. Any Kroger-brand item donated will be matched by the local Kroger store in Kennesaw.

CARE turned to their campus community partners and the one place at the Kennesaw Campus\n                     that is open 24/7:   headquarters. \n                      Since mid-March, University Police headquarters has served as the distribution point\n                     for students to pick up boxes of food on the Kennesaw Campus, and CARE has a similar\n                     arrangement with   for the Marietta Campus. Food pantry staff package and deliver the food boxes to\n                     those distribution points so they can be safely delivered to students. Also, CARE has been able to continue providing grocery store gift cards to students,\n                     by distributing them virtually. The gift cards, funded by  , are given to students with needs beyond what can be met with a pre-packaged box\n                     of food, such as those lacking transportation, having dietary restrictions or being\n                     limited in access to community resources. \u201cObviously the logistics have changed a little bit, but this is part of our year-around commitment to come together and support each other when our students and the community are in need,\u201d said C.J. Dickens of University Police\u2019s  . \u201cIt\u2019s just being part of the bigger community here at KSU. Our approach is, this is the need right now, so what do we need to do to help?\u201d Reaching students was a key challenge for the food pantry as CARE staff saw the rise in pantry visits in the days leading up to remote instruction and shelter-in-place mandates. CARE typically averages five to 15 student visits per day during the spring semester and has continued to serve 10 to 15 students a week under the new delivery system, according to program coordinator Carrie Olsen. That has included a few spikes in requests, such as 20 students asking for food boxes in just one day following KSU\u2019s spring break, and 59 students visiting the   \u2013 more than double the previous single-day high \u2013 on the Thursday prior to Kennesaw State transitioning fully to remote learning, A student seeking assistance can contact CARE Services, which then schedules an appointment for the student to pick up a 20-pound box of food at the University Police headquarters. A police officer, wearing protective gear, gives the food box to the student and offers to carry it to the student\u2019s car. The food distributions are carried out by a rotation of only three officers, in order to limit the number of people interacting with the public in compliance with social distancing guidelines. \u201cWithout this partnership, I\u2019m not sure how we would be serving our students through the pantry at this time,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cWe continue to have a number of students requesting assistance each week, and without the efforts of University Police we would be forced to serve students in a much more limited capacity.\u201d Continuing to receive support from CARE has been vital for Kennesaw State student\n                     Phoebe Sanders, who said she normally visits the food pantry every week. Sanders explained\n                     that she battles an eating disorder, and one of her doctors expressed concern that\n                     her difficulty with affording groceries could lead to Sanders restricting herself\n                     from food. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful that KSU Police has agreed to work with CARE students so we can continue to utilize the pantry,\u201d said Sanders, a junior majoring in middle grades education. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would do if I wasn\u2019t able to continue to get groceries.\u201d University Police will continue to serve as CARE Services\u2019 food distribution point for as long as needed, Dickens said. He added that this ties perfectly with the CORE unit\u2019s mission to be proactive in building a university community that works together and thrives. \u201cThe KSU community has to help our students with more than just getting good grades,\u201d Dickens said. \u201cWhen our officers see the students come in, it makes us all feel very appreciative and grateful that we\u2019re able to be here for them and they have a place to come,\u201d said University Police Deputy Chief Trudi Vaughan. \u201cWe all share that sense of it.\u201d Record Kennesaw State football crowd reflects student-engagement success Marching Owls take advantage of transitional football season for Kennesaw State Renovated Kennesaw State Marietta Campus rec center reopens Fun programs have serious purpose to engage Kennesaw State students A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its more than 43,000 students.

Since 2014, the Beacon Foundation has given $453,000 total to   (CARE) and  . Included in that amount was $10,000 to each for COVID relief at the virus\u2019s peak. Elizabeth Smith Williams, the Foundation\u2019s Cobb County trustee and KSU partner, said she is proud of the effect the Foundation\u2019s support has had on the Kennesaw State community and its students.\u00a0\n                      \n                   \u201cOur partnership with KSU has been incredibly fulfilling, especially when it comes to combating student food and housing insecurity on campus. That\u2019s one of the accomplishments that speaks directly to our mission,\u201d she said. The Beacon Foundation, run by Williams and her family, was formed in 2008 with the\n                     goal to provide poverty relief and experiences not otherwise funded through traditional\n                     means. The Foundation supports arts experiences for K-12 students, travel for college\n                     students, housing and food assistance and more. Williams said she felt since moving to Cobb County in 2007 that she had a responsibility\n                     to give to students and youth in her own backyard. CARE Services Founding Executive Director Marcy Stidum said the Beacon Foundation\n                     is one of the reasons her organization is where it is today. Stidum said Beacon has over the years supported CARE in a variety of ways, including\n                     funding a 1-bed, 1-bath Kennesaw campus apartment lease for temporary emergency housing\n                     for students who find themselves homeless. She said the temporary housing was the\n                     first of its kind to be integrated into university housing. Since that initial funding, the Foundation\u2019s support has grown to allow annual funding of a 2-bed, 2- bath Kennesaw campus apartment lease, plus emergency hotel stays, rental assistance, Atlanta Community Food Bank purchases and meal plans for students in need.\u00a0 \u201cAs a result of investments and support from donors like Beacon Foundation, CARE has become a national model for other higher education institutions,\u201d Stidum said. A year after Beacon Foundation initiated its partnership with CARE Services, it also\n                     began supporting KSU Journey Honors College and its President's Emerging Global Scholars\n                     program ( ). The mission of PEGS is to accelerate the personal, professional and academic development\n                     of exceptional Honors students. One of the main ways the program accomplishes that\n                     goal is by presenting opportunities to travel and study abroad. Williams said travel provides a new perspective for people who haven\u2019t yet experienced different cultures, but it could also result in networking opportunities that could result in a future job or scholarship. KSU Journey Honors College Interim Dean Ugena Whitlock agreed. \u201cTravel is an essential part of a well-rounded education, and thanks to Elizabeth and the Beacon Foundation, more of our students are able to broaden their horizons, both in education and in life experience,\u201d Whitlock said. \u201cThe Beacon Foundation and supporters like it are an integral part of the success of KSU Journey Honors College and of its students.\u201d Williams said she believes in the power of education, and with each bit of support\n                     KSU receives, more students can focus on their education and future, rather than obstacles\n                     to success.

Bishop joins Kennesaw State University faculty member Dr. Dominic Thomas among the participants of a three-day International\u00a0Organization for Standardization\u00a0meeting to establish systems and software maintenance guidelines in the maritime shipping industry. \n                      From June 18-20, representatives from six countries \u2013 including officials from the largest shipping company in the world, Maersk \u2013 will meet in Prillaman Hall to discuss creating technology standards for devices on shipping vessels. These standards will give users easier access to diagnostic data, and will help secure ships against cyberattacks. The attendees are all part of the ISO\u2019s TC8 committee, which establishes rules governing international ships and marine technology. Kennesaw State University\u2019s Modular Agile Development Lab, part of the Michael J. Coles College of Business, is hosting the meeting. Thomas, an Associate Professor of Information Systems, and Bishop, a student in his IS 3020 class, will provide expert support on behalf of the American National Standards Institute. The ISO consists of 164 standards-setting bodies from around the world working together\n                     to develop consistent rules governing all aspects of international trade. ANSI, which\n                     represents the U.S., chose Thomas and Bishop to attend as experts in systems processes\n                     and data interchange. \u201cTaking part in such a grand project is so exciting,\u201d says Bishop, who graduates next year. \u201cI am serving as a representative for my peers and my mentors here at KSU. I hope my performance reflects the aptitude of those who attend this prestigious school.\u201d BIMCO, the world\u2019s largest shipping association, recently submitted a draft to the ISO of proposed standards that would give users remote access to shipboard equipment statuses, allowing for real-time monitoring of everything from a ship\u2019s radar and communications systems to its refrigeration units. Realizing the benefits, but also noticing some opportunities for improvement, Bishop and Thomas worked together for weeks to put together a series of recommendations. The two also created a diagram outlining the potential flow of information, as well\n                     as a mock database for running simulations. They plan to present these items at the\n                     meeting. \u201cDr. Thomas and I spent many hours discussing the possibilities of our recommended system,\u201d Bishop says, \u201cand I think the potential we envision will be realized by everyone that\u2019s part of the project.\u201d \n                      Increased computerization in the shipping industry has created a pressing need for a single technology standard for logging and reporting critical shipboard information, says Steve O\u2019Malley, Chairman of the ISO TC8 Committee. \u201cShippers have to know exactly what software they are using,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause if that software acts up, it\u2019s going to affect everything they do. If they suffer a software crash, the ship is down for three days. That represents hundreds of thousands of dollars per day in lost income.\u201d O\u2019Malley, who lives in Kennesaw and has a daughter enrolled in the Coles College, chose to hold the meeting at Kennesaw State after speaking with Thomas, who has worked on developing technology standards in other industries. Thomas recommended hosting it under the umbrella of the MAD Lab, an incubator for student researchers to develop new information system technologies. Dr. Solomon Negash, Director of the MAD Lab, says the meeting will provide students \u2013 who are allowed to observe \u2013 with a unique look at the standards-creation process. \u201cThe MAD Lab encourages hands-on learning for the KSU community,\u201d he says. \u201cHosting the ISO standards meeting creates an opportunity for students, faculty, and staff to engage with industry practitioners.\u201d Along with the University\u2019s growing prestige among the business community, the chance to inspire business students to develop an interest in standards was key to O\u2019Malley\u2019s choice to host the event at Kennesaw State. He says that young people rarely pay attention to the process, despite its significant importance to international business. \u201cThe U.S. in general does not participate in international standards,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich puts us at a disadvantage. If you know what changes are going to happen, then you can change your business\u2026I talked with Dominic about getting young people involved so they can understand where all the weird things they find in contracts actually come from.\u201d This week\u2019s meeting is the first in what could be a months-long process to develop and release a full set of technology standards governing shipboard devices. O\u2019Malley says the committee could hold future meetings at Kennesaw State, but there are no plans at this time. Thomas is optimistic that the meeting at Kennesaw State will be instrumental to the\n                     overall process. \u201cThe hope is that this meeting we will be able to get past general guidelines and arrive at the first releasable version for the standard that can enable a first wave of improvements,\u201d he says.

One of the students, Natalie Jackson \u2013 a rising junior from Newnan majoring in marketing \u2013 shared some of her thoughts on the trip she described as \u201cone of the most enjoyable and adventurous things I have ever done.\u201d It was her second time studying abroad, after having traveled with PEGS to Costa Rica last year. \n                      \n                   \u201cI wanted to have a \u2018one of a kind\u2019 college experience that I would never forget. I knew that, if I was accepted into the President\u2019s Emerging Global Scholars program, I would travel to the gorgeous beaches of Costa Rica and see the ancient beauty of Italy. Once I was accepted to the program, so many people told me that world travel would change my life. That is so true; studying abroad allows you to discover so much about the countries that you visit as well as reveals hidden aspects about home.\u201d \u201cI created so many favorite memories in Italy that it is hard to pick just one. A friend told me that I needed to go horseback riding while I was there, so I jumped at the chance. I was able to ride horses with a few friends through the rolling hills, mountains and vineyards of Tuscany. I saw the most incredible views of Italy that could not be seen and enjoyed as much on foot or in a car. I was also able to laugh and talk to some close friends. Another one of my favorite experiences was making our own pasta at a local farm in Montepulciano. Making our own pasta turned into a five-course homemade meal that was some of the best food I have ever eaten!\u201d \n                      \n                   \u201cWith all of the history that Italy has, and the importance of the history, not much of an emphasis was put on the beauty in nature that it has as well. If you are ever in Montepulciano, climb to the top of the bell tower. You will be in awe!\u201d \u201cI would say that the history really \u2018clicked\u2019 for me. From Michelangelo\u2019s greatest art pieces to Galileo\u2019s inventions and discoveries to incredible Roman ruins, I was able to put visual pictures to the things that I had been learning about since my earliest education. It was mind-blowing to see these things right in front of me and have the historical facts I knew actually come to life. History became less of being just a bunch of stories and more of something I am able to cherish and understand.\u201d \n                      \n                   \u201cDo it! My two study abroad trips have been the highlight of my first two college years, and I am already trying to decide what my third trip will be. I cannot tell you enough that this will change your life for the better and ignite a spark in you that will make you more curious about the world.\u201d \u2013 Paul Floeckher Photos submitted Kennesaw State names recipients of 2023 Alumni Awards Kennesaw State economic impact climbs to more than $2 billion in 2022 Kennesaw State University MBA Students Explore Israel's Business Landscape Coles College Professor Provides Internship Opportunities for Local High School Students Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

Enactus students build the creations \u2013 also called Broots \u2013 using cans donated by local breweries, and have earned more than $8,000 selling them at farmer\u2019s markets and outdoor festivals. \u00a0 \n                      \n                   Much of\u00a0BROOTS's appeal comes from the cans themselves. The local breweries students have partnered with, including Dry County Brewery in Kennesaw and Reformation Brewery in Woodstock, are known for the distinctive artwork on their cans. \u201cSomeone came up to us at a farmer\u2019s market and said that the aluminum can is for our generation what the vinyl record is for hers,\u201d says BROOTS Project Manager Jacob Carney, a junior Integrated Studies major. \u201cIt\u2019s like a canvas for artwork. Sometimes I think the can sells more Broots than the plant itself.\u201d Enactus is a global student organization promoting socially responsible entrepreneurship. The Kennesaw State team is part of the\u00a0Coles College of Business's Robin and Doug Shore Entrepreneurship Center. Proceeds from the sale of Broots support sustainability education efforts at local elementary schools, such as Dowell Elementary in Marietta, where Enactus students have built a greenhouse and outdoor garden. The Enactus team has also led students on field trips to Kennesaw State\u2019s Hickory Grove Farm. \n                      Since 2010, Enactus had used corporate grants to fund these projects, with the club\n                     receiving between $1,000 and $1,500 each year. However, in 2018 their corporate sponsor\n                     pivoted away from supporting sustainability initiatives, leaving Enactus searching\n                     for alternative sources of funding. Their first idea was to recycle aluminum cans at Kennesaw State football tailgate\n                     parties. Enactus began working with Dry County Brewery, who provided collection bins\n                     and refreshments. After several weeks, the Enactus team realized the economics of\n                     this arrangement did not work out. \u201cThe issue is that the rates for recycling cans in Georgia are not very good,\u201d says Andrew Tutwiler, former President of Enactus and an originator of the BROOTS idea. \u201cIf we lived in California or Hawaii, we would have made a killing. But here, we recycled over 200 pounds of cans and made out with only about $80.\u201d Tutwiler eventually suggested repurposing the cans instead of recycling them. \u201cI knew that people are really into repurposed art these days, and that succulents are very trendy,\u201d he says. \u201cWith some deliberations from the group, we realized that we could mass produce these.\u201d In addition to the initial cans, Dry County also provided the BROOTS team with spent grain they would have otherwise thrown away. The students composted the grain to create the soil where they now grow the succulents, which they purchase from a wholesale distributor in Florida. All of the work takes place in the Enactus faculty advisor\u2019s backyard. The goal is for BROOTS to be as economically and environmentally sustainable as possible. \n                      Their approach is working. Between operating a weekly stall at the Marietta Farmer\u2019s Market, as well as their presence this spring at the SweetWater 420 Festival, the team has sold hundreds of $10 Broots, earning more than $8,000. With BROOTS\u2019s earnings sitting at more than five times the value of their lost grant, the Enactus team is ready to do more for sustainability education. \u201cI\u2019d like to see the schools\u00a0Enactus partners with develop to a point where they are growing enough food that they have a surplus and can sell it at the BROOTS stand,\u201d Tutwiler says. \u201cAnd then\u00a0Enactus could\u00a0move to the next school and restart the program.\u201d In May, the Enactus team included BROOTS as part of their presentation at the Enactus\n                     National Expo in Kansas City. The team placed first in their division during the opening\n                     round before finishing third in the semi-finals. \u201cBROOTS is a great project and provides excellent community outreach,\u201d says Enactus Faculty Advisor Dennis Loubiere, jokingly adding that the project has taken over his home. \u201cIt meets both the goals of the University and of the Coles College of Business.\u201d Carney, who took over as BROOTS\u2019 project manager after Tutwiler\u2019s graduation this spring, would like to see the project continue to expand. Plans include opening an online store, working with breweries to create BROOTS-specific can designs, and potentially purchasing a special printer so that the team could design their own labels. \u201cI\u2019d love to use the money to build greenhouses all over Atlanta,\u201d he says.\u00a0 Photos by Patrick Harbin and Dennis Loubiere Kennesaw State names recipients of 2023 Alumni Awards Kennesaw State economic impact climbs to more than $2 billion in 2022 Kennesaw State University MBA Students Explore Israel's Business Landscape Coles College Professor Provides Internship Opportunities for Local High School Students Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

He has adapted quite well. Now a rising senior at Kennesaw State University, Heath is in the\u00a0Coles Scholars Program\u00a0for the top students in the\u00a0Michael J. Coles College of Business\u00a0and is set to earn his finance degree next spring. He also recently participated in a weeklong residential education program hosted by one of the nation\u2019s best business schools. Heath was selected for the Harvard Business School\u2019s Summer Venture in Management, which simulates being a student in Harvard\u2019s renowned Master of Business Administration program. The summer program gives participants a broader understanding of challenges business leaders face, the many dimensions of the business world, and the impact they can have on their community and the world through business leadership. \n                      \n                   \u201cBeing chosen for the program is the fruition of years of work,\u201d Heath said. \u201cIt took some time to get used to the U.S. education system after I moved here, but I felt that coming to KSU was a chance to start fresh. There are tons of opportunities here, and I had the mindset that I was going to take the opportunities that are out there for me. I definitely didn\u2019t do it alone, though; I\u2019m thankful for my great support system of people who have helped me along the way.\u201d One of those opportunities was the Summer Venture in Management, where Heath took\n                     classes led by Harvard professors on current management issues. The participants analyzed\n                     real business cases and divided into study groups to examine and debate their ideas. Joining Heath in the Harvard program were students from across the country, including several from schools recognized among the nation\u2019s best. He credited the Coles College with preparing him well for the experience through his classroom learning, the faculty\u2019s expertise and assistance, and the camaraderie among his fellow Coles Scholars. \u201cI think I was able to show that you don\u2019t have to be from Yale or Columbia or Stanford to sit at the same table as them,\u201d Heath said. \u201cPeople say KSU is an up-and-coming school, but I think that it\u2019s already here. There definitely is talent throughout our student body.\u201d With that in mind, Heath hopes other Kennesaw State students will pursue learning\n                     and leadership opportunities like the one he participated in at Harvard. At the conclusion\n                     of the program, he was asked to be a Harvard Business School ambassador to help promote\n                     the Summer Venture in Management. The application process for the program included writing an essay that gave an example\n                     of Heath demonstrating leadership. Heath, who served two terms in student government\n                     at Kennesaw State, wrote about his experience working with another student senator\n                     to establish a learning community for degree-seeking students with disabilities. \u201cThat was one of my proudest accomplishments,\u201d Heath said. \u201cIt meant a lot to me personally.\u201d Heath aspires to attend the Harvard Business School for its dual Juris Doctor/Master of Business Administration program after he graduates from Kennesaw State next May. One of Heath\u2019s career goals is to return to the London area to work as an executive for a soccer team, since he is a huge fan of the sport from growing up in the U.K. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was quite ready to graduate yet, but then attending the program and seeing what my future could hold made me refocus,\u201d Heath said. \u201cAs much as I\u2019ve loved being at KSU, I\u2019m ready to wrap up my time here and see what the next chapter holds.\u201d Photos by Jason Getz Kennesaw State names recipients of 2023 Alumni Awards Kennesaw State economic impact climbs to more than $2 billion in 2022 Kennesaw State University MBA Students Explore Israel's Business Landscape Coles College Professor Provides Internship Opportunities for Local High School Students Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

Today, Gilbert\u2019s new business venture \u2013 called Esgro \u2013 aims to help service providers avoid similar frustrations. Gilbert, who is a junior in the electrical engineering program, is preparing a beta\n                     test of his unique payment platform in August. He and his team have been working alongside\n                     the Robin and Doug Shore Entrepreneurship Center to develop the project, and are now\n                     pitching to investors. They have also launched a crowdfunding campaign. \n                      Designed for workers in the emerging gig economy, Esgro helps independent service\n                     providers guarantee they receive payment for services. When a client uses Esgro to\n                     hire a contractor for any service, from babysitting and landscaping to freelance writing\n                     and media services, both parties agree on a price, and the client pays the full amount\n                     into an Esgro-managed account. Esgro releases payment once the provider completes\n                     the task. Both parties also agree on a payment amount in cases of cancellation. \n                      The application helps avoid disputes between service providers and clients, eliminating the need for split payments (where clients pay half their bill in advance) and costly trips to small claims court.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a problem that hundreds of industries face when dealing with services,\u201d Gilbert says. \u201cThere has been no great solution for transacting for services. There are plenty of archaic methods we\u2019ve used in the past to mitigate risks, but they don\u2019t really solve everything.\u201d Gilbert came up with Esgro in April 2018 while working part time as a physics and\n                     calculus tutor for high school students. Even though he enjoyed the work, frequent\n                     cancellations put a strain on his budget. He began designing a system that would help\n                     small service providers secure payments, while also giving clients control over the\n                     quality of the work. He immediately took the idea to his friend Payton Johnson, a computer science graduate\n                     from Georgia Tech, and the two began working on the technology. Realizing they had\n                     a unique idea on their hands, they brought in Themiya Chandraratna, also a Georgia\n                     Tech computer science graduate, and reached out to the Coles College of Business Entrepreneurship\n                     Center for guidance on launching Esgro. Gilbert and his team learned many valuable lessons from the EC, including that it\n                     takes more than raising money to start a business. \u201cWhen you first start out, all you think about is funding,\u201d he says. \u201cYou say \u2018I have this great idea. Now I need to get money to make it.\u2019 That\u2019s not at all how it works. Over the last 14 months, I\u2019ve luckily had the opportunity to learn a lot from [the EC].\u201d With the EC\u2019s help, the Esgro team refined the product, developed a business plan, built their brand, and researched the application\u2019s viability in the marketplace. In addition, EC Executive Director Greg Quinet and Dr. Mark Hiatt, Assistant Professor of Entrepreneurship, were able to open doors for Gilbert once the company was ready to seek financial backing. \u201cThis involved introducing Caleb to angel investors, venture capital firms, and industry experts that would have a direct interest in what Caleb\u2019s company is developing,\u201d says Hiatt, who is now on Esgro\u2019s advisory board. \u201cGreg and I used our business contacts to make these introductions in the most expedient means possible.\u201d A big win for Esgro came earlier this year when the company was accepted into the Charlotte, N.C.-based Queen City Fintech, the largest financial technology business accelerator in the Southeast. Esgro was one of only eight companies this year to make it in out of 400 that applied. Gilbert says completing the accelerator has enhanced Esgro\u2019s reputation, opening up more opportunities for investment. With the product moving into its beta test, and with 50 companies signing letters\n                     of intent to use Esgro, Gilbert and his team are preparing for their public launch.\n                     Their current goal is to raise $500,000 to build out an engineering and support staff. The company recently launched a crowdfunding campaign where they are giving anyone\n                     the opportunity to invest in Esgro for as little as $20. Gilbert says it is important\n                     that a company servicing independent service providers allow those providers to have\n                     a stake in it. \u201cThis business was started by students with students in mind,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s students from their schools building something. We wanted to give everyone the ability to jump onboard and share in the purpose and the vision of this company.\u201d Esgro is just one of the many student-run businesses nurtured by the EC. According to Hiatt, the Center, as well as Kennesaw State University\u2019s innovative entrepreneurship degree program, have contributed to a culture of entrepreneurship across the University. \u201cThe active outreach that the EC provides to the university and local community, combined with the up-to-date courses taught by former entrepreneurs, and the many students that come to us with an entrepreneurial drive, all creates an environment that strongly encourages the development of the entrepreneurial mindset and skillset,\u201d he says.

Also, the annual\u00a0National Collegiate Sales Competition\u00a0hosted by Kennesaw State is the largest and oldest collegiate sales competition in the world. \u00a0 \u201cI saw the Center for Professional Selling as a place with endless amounts of opportunity for students, so I dove in my freshman year,\u201d Colapinto said. \u201cAs the semesters progressed, I started advancing my skills and building deeper relationships, and it became a community that continued to challenge me and help me develop professionally.\u201d \u00a0 Colapinto joined the sales competition team as an alternate as a freshman, became a fixture on the team the following year and then was voted by her peers to be team captain. She was a four-time winner of the Sales Cup, a competition every semester in which KSU students earn points through participating in sales competitions, demonstrating leadership in the sales program and being involved in the Sales Club \u2013 an organization Colapinto co-founded and served as president. \u00a0 \u201cMegan is one of the most dedicated individuals I have had the pleasure to work with in my 27 years in academe,\u201d Loe said. \u201cShe exemplifies the ideal student and will be a valuable asset to any organization with whom she is affiliated. Megan has raised the bar for our current and future sales program students.\u201d \u00a0 Colapinto also is in the\u00a0Coles College Scholars Program\u00a0for KSU\u2019s top business students. Coles Scholars earn a minor in the two-year program that focuses on leadership development, integrated and international studies, community engagement and mentorship. Colapinto traveled with her Coles Scholars cohort to the Dominican Republic last year on a social entrepreneurship trip, during which the students assessed needs in the communities they visited and proposed solutions. She took a second\u00a0education abroad\u00a0trip this spring, to Greece to experience the culture and study international sales and marketing. \u00a0 \u201cBeing part of both the Center for Professional Sellingand the Coles Scholars Program completely shaped not only my college experience, but who I am as a person \u2013 because of the people I met and the experiences, challenges and opportunities I had,\u201d Colapinto said. \u201cThose programs changed the trajectory of how I spent these four years and where I will go from here.\u201d \u00a0 Not surprisingly, Colapinto already has a full-time job lined up prior to receiving her degree from Kennesaw State. In June, she began a 12-month training program with Ciena, a networking systems, services and software company. Colapinto will become a sales engineer, designing and creating networks to meet clients\u2019 needs in response to constantly changing demands and advancements. \u00a0 \u201cI love opportunities that challenge me and help me grow my skill set, capabilities and critical thinking,\u201d Colapinto said. \u201cI have learned that hard work is fun when you are passionate.\u201d \u2014 Paul\u00a0Floeckher Photography by Jason Getz Kennesaw State names recipients of 2023 Alumni Awards Kennesaw State economic impact climbs to more than $2 billion in 2022 Kennesaw State University MBA Students Explore Israel's Business Landscape Coles College Professor Provides Internship Opportunities for Local High School Students Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

His role involves managing the interdisciplinary\u00a0Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity program and developing additional cybersecurity degrees, certificates and professional education opportunities. \u00a0 He brings more than 20 years of experience teaching information security courses.\n                     A distinguished researcher and author, Whitman has written 10 widely used textbooks\n                     and published information systems research in top academic journals. He also is the\n                     executive director of the   (CISE), which supports cybersecurity education initiatives across the region. \u00a0 \u201cMike Whitman has years of experience developing and leading cybersecurity education,\u201d said Jon Preston, dean of the  , who was part of the committee that appointed Whitman. \u201cAdditionally, he has a strong ability to work with all students, faculty and staff within the contributing colleges to make the Institute successful.\u201d \u00a0 Kennesaw State formed the ICWD in 2017 as part of a statewide initiative to encourage businesses and governments to create cybersecurity jobs in Georgia. Answering the University System of Georgia\u2019s call for a comprehensive, online cybersecurity degree, the ICWD established Kennesaw State\u2019s B.S. in Cybersecurity the same year. \u00a0 Offered exclusively online through the USG\u2019s eMajor platform, the B.S. in Cybersecurity is a collaboration between the\u00a0Michael J. Coles College of Business, the College of Computing and Software Engineering, and the  . The ICWD oversees the program by scheduling the courses, coordinating with the academic\n                     departments on faculty schedules and representing the program inside and outside the\n                     University. \u00a0 Whitman was one of the initial organizers of the ICWD as well as a key architect of the cybersecurity degree program. As ICWD\u2019s executive director, one of his focuses will be on managing the degree\u2019s rapid growth. \u00a0 \u201cEnrollment already is far ahead of what we expected,\u201d Whitman said. \u201cAt the end of year one, we already were at year three enrollment projections. The short-term tactical challenges will be to manage that growth.\u201d Program enrollment currently sits at more than 430 students, Whitman said, adding that Kennesaw State plans to hire additional cybersecurity faculty in the\u00a0Information Technology\u00a0and Information Systems departments. \u00a0 Under Whitman\u2019s leadership, the ICWD also will assume management of several key initiatives previously conducted by the CISE, including organizing the annual  ; hosting the  ; and publishing the  . \u00a0 \u201cThis should enhance those opportunities, as the events will now be seen as much more interdisciplinary in nature,\u201d Whitman said. \u201cWe hope to attract more faculty and student interest because they will see that these activities are not just part of the Coles College of Business.\u201d \u00a0 Whitman said the ICWD\u2019s interdisciplinary focus is one of the key things that attracted him to the position. The program requires students to complete IT courses offered by the CCSE and Information Security and Assurance courses through the Coles College, while offering criminal justice electives in cybercrime through the CHSS. \u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s unique in that it really brings together several disciplines,\u201d Whitman said. \u201cSome computer-related, some not. That really allows students to tailor their degree program to their personal interests and career preferences.\u201d \u00a0 The B.S. in Cybersecurity is one of three cybersecurity-focused degrees offered by\n                     Kennesaw State, along with the more managerial Bachelor of Business Administration\n                     in Information Security and Assurance through the Coles College and the Bachelor of\n                     Science in Information Technology through theCollege of Computing and Software Engineering.\n                     All three degrees have helped KSU earn a reputation for producing skilled information\n                     security graduates. \u00a0 CyberDegrees.org ranked Kennesaw State first in its\u00a02019 list of the top cybersecurity degrees, while Military Timesranked the University among the top 10 best cybersecurity programs for veterans. Kennesaw State is also recognized by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance/Cybersecurity for the years 2015-2021. \u00a0 Whitman earned a Ph.D. in Management Information Systems from Auburn University\u2019s Harbert College of Business and previously served in the U.S. Army as an officer in the 2nd Armored Cavalry with duties as an automated data processing system security officer. \u2014 Patrick Harbin Kennesaw State names recipients of 2023 Alumni Awards Kennesaw State economic impact climbs to more than $2 billion in 2022 Kennesaw State University MBA Students Explore Israel's Business Landscape Coles College Professor Provides Internship Opportunities for Local High School Students Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

Cancellation and No-Show Policy, will I be charged? Support Letters CPS does not provide documentation for any purpose that falls outside of supporting\n                                       the academic mission of KSU. This includes documentation to assist with complying\n                                       with legal mandates, such as court mandated anger management, substance abuse assessment,\n                                       treatment or evaluation, child custody evaluations, domestic violence counseling or\n                                       the fulfillment of probation or parole requirements. CPS staff does not provide letters at the time of an initial consultation and cannot provide documentation regarding a student's mental health without a history of services at CPS during the specified time period.\u00a0 If necessary, students are encouraged to seek letters of support from professionals directly involved in their care such as past or present psychological/psychiatric providers, or medical health providers.\u00a0 Emotional Support Animals (ESA) Counseling and Psychological Services does not provide consultations or support documentation for emotional support animals (ESAs).\u00a0 ESA documentation is typically only helpful for housing and travel-related situations, which is distinguishable from service animals.\u00a0 Most off-campus providers are able to offer these services. Visit our off-campus referral database:\u00a0 We recommend that you contact a couple of providers to confirm if they are willing to provide ESA consultation/ documentation, how many sessions, and what price.\u00a0\u00a0 There are also some online services that provide ESA consultation and documentation,\n                                       although they tend not to be as reputable: If you live off-campus and are renting, you would need to contact your landlord for\n                                       their ESA documentation requirements.

Philosophy The intent of our Doctoral Internship in Health Services Psychology is to provide\n                     a broadly based and integrated scholar-practitioner program for this conclusive year\n                     of graduate training in clinical or counseling psychology. The program is grounded\n                     in psychological science and is a developmentally sequenced, experientially driven\n                     training model, with training occurring across multiple intervention modalities; intensive\n                     individual and group supervision characterize the program, with didactic seminar experiences\n                     and professional consultation providing depth and breadth. The KSU internship is designed to prepare multiculturally competent and ethically\n                     attentive professional psychologists who can enter the field with proficiency, creativity\n                     and flexibility in a variety of positions, providing clinical, consultation and outreach\n                     services to adults in outpatient settings, and providing training to their own students\n                     and other clinicians. CPS staff members value our multicultural, multidisciplinary and multi-theoretical\n                     learning and working environment. Enhancement of multicultural skills is a central\n                     component of our program, with related issues being addressed in all aspects of the\n                     training program and staff actively engaged in examining our own multiple identities.\n                     Our shared awareness of developmental challenges and of brief therapy provide common\n                     ground for CPS staff and will become core to CPS intern training. Location Kennesaw State University (KSU) is located approximately 25 miles northwest of Atlanta,\n                     GA. KSU is a member of the University System of Georgia and the third-largest university\n                     in the state with over 40,000 students. Three related campus locations currently house\n                     19 professional staff members and three office assistants. On the Kennesaw campus\n                     and residing in Kennesaw Hall is the largest group of clinicians, with 12 professional\n                     staff, a psychiatrist, and 5-7 practicum trainees with an office manager and administrative\n                     assistants. Also on the Kennesaw campus is the Residential College that houses two\n                     professional staff members and one practicum trainee. The Marietta campus, located\n                     about 9 miles south of the Kennesaw campus, houses four professional staff, a psychiatric\n                     nurse practitioner, and 2-4 practicum trainees in their office in the student center,\n                     along with one administrative assistant. All of the locations function as one with\n                     the same policies and procedures guiding them. Interns may be based out of any of\n                     the locations or function across different sites as service demands dictate. Regardless\n                     of location, interns have access to their own supervisors or other licensed psychologists\n                     in addition to on-call counselors at all times at all locations. All office locations provide office space, with computers and video-tape programs\n                     to assist with intern activities. Phones and clerical support are also available at\n                     each site. The Staff The reflects a diversity of training with 4 counseling psychologists, 2 clinical psychologists,\n                     2 psychology associates, 5 licensed professional counselors, 4 licensed clinical social\n                     workers, one marriage and family counselor, one psychiatrist and one psychiatric nurse\n                     practitioner. Our providers operate from the range of theoretical orientations (e.g.,\n                     psychodynamic, humanistic, cognitive behavioral, and relational-cultural). In short,\n                     CPS staff members endorse and value our multicultural, multidisciplinary and multi-theoretical\n                     learning and working environment. Enhancement of multicultural skills is a central\n                     component of our program, with related issues being addressed in all aspects of the\n                     training program and in the professional growth and development of regular staff members.\n                     Three doctoral interns will join this staff. The Clients KSU interns will have the opportunity to work with a broad college student clientele.\n                     KSU students come from widely diverse backgrounds so that interns might work with\n                     first generation, rural or urban students- White, Asian, Hispanic or Black students-\n                     gay, straight, transgender or cisgender students- Christian, Muslim or Hindu students,\n                     and so many other groups that they cannot all be named here. Similarly, KSU students\n                     present with the broad range of developmental, relational and psychological problems;\n                     these most often involve students with anxiety, depression, relationship conflicts\n                     and academic concerns. However, interns could also gain exposure to working with more\n                     severe problems, including students with autistic spectrum disorders, bipolar disorders,\n                     personality disordered clients or clients with emerging schizophrenia. The Experience CPS interns will routinely work 40 hours per week with 10 Holidays and the ability\n                     to accumulate vacation and sick leave through the Georgia State system. The 2000-hour\n                     internship will be completed over a 12-month time frame. Interns will be compensated\n                     at $34,486.00 for the year. Interns will have the opportunity to choose two of five\n                     rotation specialties over the course of their training year. These include: Groups,\n                     Trauma, Crisis Management, Supervision and Assessment. CPS endorses a brief therapy model (up to 16 sessions per academic year) and all counseling clients enter the system through triage (initial consultations/ICs). Interns will provide 3-4 hours of ICs and schedule approximately 18 individual client hours per week. Interns will cover at least 1.15 hours of group counseling per week but may cover more with additional group commitments. Interns will provide and later supervise practicum trainees on delivering structured workshops on Anxiety and Depression for CPS clients. Interns may also supervise a master\u2019s counselor on individual therapy depending on rotation commitments.\u00a0 Interns will conduct a minimum of 4 psychological test batteries, materials provided by CPS.\u00a0 The Training The CPS internship at KSU provides training across multiple intervention modalities,\n                     and interns can expect to gain competency with individual and group counseling, as\n                     well as with developing and presenting psychoeducational workshops and other preventive\n                     programs. Intensive individual and group supervision characterize the program, with\n                     interns receiving 2 hours of individual supervision per week, along with supervision\n                     of group counseling. Further, interns will participate in a weekly Case Conference/Cluster meeting in which\n                     interns, staff and other students will present clinical cases for disposition, case\n                     management and case conceptualization. In total Interns will receive a minimum of\n                     5 and up to 6 hours of training per week through the internship. Two didactic seminar experiences will be provided, including a Clinical Seminar, which\n                     will focus on case conceptualization with application of psychological theory and\n                     science. A Special Topics Seminar will focus on Diversity, Groups, Supervision, Assessment\n                     and Professional issues. Intern training will be focused around Rotation specialties\n                     as follows: The interns completing their training at CPS will emerge with a strong foundation\n                     in the health services psychology fields, and with the skills to enter their post-doctoral\n                     training with confidence and excitement. The Evaluation Process Supervisors will meet with interns at the beginning of each semester to set specific goals for intern growth and development, and these will be documented for evaluation. Intern supervisors will provide ongoing feedback to interns through the training year and the rights and responsibilities of each party will be addressed explicitly in writing. These formal written evaluations will occur three times per year with clinical supervisors. Primary and Secondary supervisors will both complete evaluations of Intern Competency midyear and at the end of the training year. Verbal feedback will be shared with the intern during supervision on an on-going basis, and any problems with intern\u2019s behavior or progress will be discussed explicitly. In order to measure minimum level of competency, the following ratings will be used On this scale: meets the minimum level of achievement required in all elements of PWCs evaluated\n                     for completion of the internship \u00a0Intern\u2019s performance demonstrates a level of competence that exceeds the level expected of an intern at this stage in training. The use of the element is consistently incorporated into the intern's work and is evident in their daily professional practice. Intern is able to reflect on their experience of the element and knows when to consult. The intern is aware of the element and routinely applies it in their work without\n                     need for assistance. The intern seeks greater learning about and understanding of\n                     the element as a form of ongoing development. This is the minimal level of competence\n                     needed for successful completion of the training program and entry-level practice. The intern is aware of the element and can utilize this awareness to inform their\n                     work in the internship setting, though the intern may still need assistance didactically\n                     or experientially in order to regularly utilize the element in their direct service.\n                     The application of learning to practice may be inconsistent. Ongoing supervision and\n                     monitoring is focused on continued advancement, integration, and consistency. The intern has a basic foundation in the element and moves toward acquiring competence\n                     in it. The intern may have cognitive understanding or experiential skill with the\n                     element, but those may not be well integrated. Significant supervision and monitoring\n                     are required to support the skill level needed for entry-level practice. The intern does not understand or is unable to effectively demonstrate the element\n                     that is expected at this time in the training experience OR the intern exhibits behaviors\n                     indicating lack of readiness for the work that is required in the internship setting.\n                     A doctoral intern evaluated at this level will require immediate augmented supervision or structured\n                     training opportunities. completes the rating levels. By the end of the training year, interns will have developed appropriate levels of\n                     competence in the required Profession Wide Competencies. Intern Selection Interns must be completing doctoral training in Clinical or Counseling Psychology\n                     and must have completed three years of related academic work, and at least two 9-month,\n                     supervised practicum experiences. Selected CPS interns must pass a background check\n                     with the Human Resource Dept. prior to beginning work at KSU. Interns will be selected based on 1) a review of their academic record in a doctoral program in Clinical or Counseling Psychology, 2) a review of the number and type of direct service hours completed in supervised practicum training, 3) progress in completing program requirements (e.g., Comprehensive Exams, Dissertation proposal), 4) application materials (Letter of interest, Personal Essays, and Letters of Recommendation) and 5) an interview with the Training Committee (which may take place virtually or in person). \u00a0 CPS does not discriminate on the basis of\u00a0race, color, sex (including sexual harassment and pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, ethnicity or national origin, religion, age, genetic information, disability, or veteran or military status.\u00a0Any needed accommodations should be made known after applicants are selected for interviews.

Coles College of Business is injecting some fun into its career-readiness\n                     program in a move to inspire students to get serious about planning for their futures. Launched this semester by Coles College Undergraduate Programs, the Flight Academy\n                     is an engagement program built on the Suitable software platform that awards points\n                     to students who participate in activities that help prepare them for life after graduation.\n                     These include attending career fairs, guest lectures, academic program information\n                     sessions, career prep workshops, and a variety of other development activities. \u201cWhat we want is for students to explore different activities that will get them to ask \u2018which major is right for me?\u2019,\u201d says Anne Winn, Coles College\u2019s Assistant Director of Undergraduate Programs. \u201cAnd \u2018are there careers that I\u2019m looking for that line up with this major?\u2019 It\u2019s all about helping students connect their education to what their future careers look like.\u201d \n                      \n                   Common ways for students to log points include scanning QR codes into the Suitable\n                     mobile application from a qualifying event or submitting written reflections. Participating in a qualified activity earns students points in one of eight categories\n                     based on necessary core competencies identified by the Flight Academy build team: \u201cThese core competencies will be enhanced by our students attending events where they will learn how to interact with employers, how to build an effective resume, and how to dress in proper business attire,\u201d says Academic Advisor ChiDozie Nkema, who worked on the build team. \u201cAt the end of the day, we want our students to increase their chances of getting a job in their field once they graduate from KSU.\u201d If developing professional skills is not enough to motivate students to engage with\n                     the Flight Academy, UP has also added a healthy dose of fun and competition into the\n                     program. Students can compare their point totals against their peers\u2019 using online leaderboards, and can rank up as they hit certain milestones. They also earn digital badges for accomplishing specific tasks. For example, students receive the Coles 101 badge for completing a series of challenges meant to introduce them to valuable College resources like the Dean\u2019s Suite, their academic advisors, and the offices for their major departments. \u201cWe understand that with Generation Z coming through college, it\u2019s a different experience for them,\u201d Winn says. \u201cTo reach them, we\u2019re going to have to meet them where they live. The games and the competition are all part of that.\u201d In addition to the bragging rights students gain as they move up the leaderboards, UP plans to offer other rewards for accumulating points. Potential rewards they are exploring range from lunch with the dean and VIP admission to Tetley Distinguished Leader Lecture series events to scholarships and honor cords for top performers\u2019 graduation caps. While the goal is to make the Flight Academy available to all Coles College students, the initial rollout includes only students in BUSA 2150, the first course in the College\u2019s Hughes Leadership and Career Program. The Hughes program is a series of three non-credit career-readiness courses that all Coles College students must complete before graduation. Students in 2150 are required to participate in development activities, which they now track within the Flight Academy. Integrating the Flight Academy into Hughes is part of a larger initiative to focus less on graded assignments in BUSA courses and more on experiential learning. Dr. Hope Baker, Associate Dean for Assessment and Undergraduate Programs, says these changes will contribute to University President Pamela Whitten\u2019s goal to make Kennesaw State a top-tier R2 institution. \u201cWe want to help students decide on a major earlier to keep them on a timely graduation path; encourage them to participate in experiential learning activities that connect then with practitioners in their fields; and provide opportunities to develop self-awareness, leadership, critical thinking, and professional polish,\u201d she says. UP will roll the Flight Academy out to BUSA 3150 and 4150 in Spring 2020 before opening\n                     it up to all Coles College students next academic year. The fun, competitive elements of the Flight Academy will ideally motivate students\n                     to continue using it once they have satisfied their BUSA requirements. From that point,\n                     the platform will become a record of development activities that students can include\n                     on their resumes. They can also send employers links to view their earned badges and\n                     developed skills. Future plans for the Flight Academy include allowing academic departments to create\n                     their own competitions and badges, working with employers to develop badges that will\n                     help them identify potential candidates, and building an alumni engagement network. \u201cI want the entire College to feel ownership of the Flight Academy and fully utilize it,\u201d Baker says. \u201cThe goal is to make it easy for faculty to manage activities, so they see it as another learning tool for their students. It needs to become an integral part of the Coles College experience.\u201d Kennesaw State names recipients of 2023 Alumni Awards Kennesaw State economic impact climbs to more than $2 billion in 2022 Kennesaw State University MBA Students Explore Israel's Business Landscape Coles College Professor Provides Internship Opportunities for Local High School Students Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

That was the advice offered by Georgia Aquarium President and Chief Operating Officer\n                     Joe Handy when he spoke to a classroom of students in the Michael J. Coles College\n                     of Business. \n                      \n                   Handy, an alum of the Coles College\u2019s Executive Master of Business Administration program, is the College\u2019s current executive in residence. That role provides him opportunities throughout the semester to interact with students inside and outside the classroom, such as during Thursday\u2019s presentation titled \u201cThink Career and Passions Don\u2019t Mix? Think Again.\u201d Using his own professional journey as an example, Handy described how following one\u2019s passions can lead to a fulfilling career, even one outside the field they originally chose. \u201cLife happens,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can still make a straight line out of a crooked stick.\u201d Growing up, Handy always saw himself becoming a defense attorney, going as far as\n                     to enroll at Daemen College in Amherst, NY, to study political science. However, he\n                     struggled in college and began questioning whether he made the right career choice. \u201cI knew I wanted to be an attorney because, in my heart, I intuitively knew I wanted to help people,\u201d Handy said. \u201cI thought being an attorney for people who were defenseless would let me provide that help for them.\u201d However, while working a summer job developing tours at the American Museum of Natural\n                     History, he realized that he could channel his passion for helping others into that\n                     role. He began to find fulfillment meeting museum patrons from around the world, learning\n                     from them, and ensuring that they got the most out of their experiences. Handy ended up working at the museum for nine years in various departments \u2013 including education, business services, security, the call center, website design, and e-commerce \u2013 before Home Depot founder Bernard Marcus tapped him to help open the Georgia Aquarium in 2005. He was promoted to his current role in 2017. Throughout everything, Handy has always been guided by his passion for helping others. \u201cThe career opportunities I\u2019ve had have been afforded to me because I knew what I wanted to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew I wanted to help people. I didn\u2019t know how, but I knew I wanted to help people.\u201d This passion extends beyond his professional life. Since earning his EMBA in 2017,\n                     Handy has dedicated himself to mentoring Kennesaw State students.

During the meeting, Whitten expressed her excitement in having accomplished alumni like Handy return to meet with students. \u201cBy highlighting successful professionals, our students can envision what is possible,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no doubt that today\u2019s interaction between Joe and our students will inspire more than a few to think beyond their limits.\u201d Handy wrapped up his presentation with a question-and-answer session where he offered\n                     valuable advice to students about finding careers that align with their passions. \u201cHave a self-audit process,\u201d he said. \u201cStart thinking about what passions you have. Think about what you know about yourself and choose a career path that allows for you to do that. Because it won\u2019t be work.

It\u2019s called a growth environment.\u201d \n                      \n                   Brown is a senior entrepreneurship major in the Michael J. Coles College of Business and the host of the Your Visionary Podcast. With its first season wrapping up this week, the show features in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs and other inspirational leaders. Produced alongside the Kennesaw State University chapter of Enactus, Your Visionary Podcast has received more than 1,000 downloads from fans across the county since December, and has become a valuable part of many people\u2019s lives. However, only five years ago, Brown quit college and found himself without any real\n                     direction. Realizing that he had to make a change, Brown soon began a personal journey\n                     to turn his life around. Brown originally enrolled at Kennesaw State University in 2014 after graduating from Grayson High School. While highly intelligent \u2013 he scored a nearly perfect score on an entrance exam \u2013 he lacked direction. \u201cMy Freshman year I didn\u2019t really know what I was doing,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t entrepreneurial-minded. When I first got here, all I was doing was partying. I was going down the wrong path.\u201d During his sophomore year, he lost the lease on his off-campus apartment after a SWAT\n                     team raided it looking for his roommate who was wanted in connection with a violent\n                     crime. Following this incident, Brown dropped out of college and moved in with some\n                     friends who were business students at Georgia State University. Changing the people he associated with turned out to be the push Brown needed to build\n                     a better life for himself. Inspired by his roommates, who were all developing business ideas, Brown began exploring\n                     his own options. He found success by contracting with a Chinese manufacturer to sell\n                     baby products under the name Healthy Comfy Living. After buying some social media\n                     advertisements and contracting with a popular social media influencer, his company\n                     soon took off. He also got a job loading baggage onto planes for Delta Airlines. With a steady income\n                     and a Delta employee discount, he became a world traveler, visiting 13 countries in\n                     one year. \n                      \n                   Traveling helped Brown develop a passion for writing. He kept detailed journals of\n                     his adventures, and self-published two books: Blue Dreams, about his travels in the\n                     Bahamas, and Negus in Nicaragua. While on a trip to Senegal, Brown was shocked by the level of poverty he saw. But,\n                     he was more surprised by the positive attitudes of the people he met in spite of their\n                     circumstances. \u201cIt made me think that if they can live there and still be happy, then why is anyone in America ever sad,\u201d he says. \u201cI realized that everyone struggles with something. Life is about finding happiness in the struggle.\u201d That became Brown\u2019s purpose statement \u2013 to help people find happiness in their struggle through his writing. He sold his business, re-enrolled in Kennesaw State as an entrepreneurship major, and began pursuing a writing career. On his first day of class in Entrepreneurship 4001 in Fall 2017, Brown met Mike Russell, a Kennesaw State alumnus and CEO of ETS Solutions, who was visiting as a guest speaker. After learning about Brown\u2019s unique story, Russell offered to be his mentor. \u201cAfter our first meeting, I knew that\u00a0CeeJ was not only going to be my mentee, but also my mentor,\u201d says Russell. \u201cI have learned so much from him and he also challenges me with questions about strategy and motivation. We now meet weekly to discuss relevant issues, business ideas, corporate culture, and core values.\u201d Russell gave Brown valuable advice about the importance of finding success in his\n                     passions, not only in what will make money. He also introduced Brown to his network\n                     of prominent Atlanta-area businesspeople, some of whom Brown has since ghostwritten\n                     books for. Brown started the Your Visionary Podcast in December 2018 as a way to share that power\n                     of mentorship with other college students. \u201cI saw the problems that my peers had in terms of not having a clear direction,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I saw how having a mentor changed my trajectory. I created a platform where I could have other mentors speak to students and inspire them; show them that everyone has their own unique story.\u201d Guests on Your Visionary Podcast have included former circus ringmaster and current motivational speaker Bronkar Lee; Adrion Porter, a brand strategist with marketing experience at Cartoon Network and HBO; and international dancer Tacir Roberson, whose work can be seen in the music video for Beyonce\u2019s song Partition. \n                      \n                   Brown records the show in a dedicated podcast studio at Ignite HQ, a business incubator in Marietta that often collaborates with Kennesaw State\u2019s Doug and Robin Shore Entrepreneurship Center. He is also a member of the Kennesaw State chapter of the socially responsible entrepreneurship organization Enactus, which helps produce the podcast.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe are always looking for inventive ways to improve our community,\u201d says Dennis Loubierre, the chapter\u2019s faculty advisor. \u201cCeeJ's\u00a0outreach to students is very relevant to today\u2019s students. His motivation is to inspire people to reach their full potentials and to be a role model for success.\u201d \n                      \n                   New episodes of Your Visionary Podcast release on Thursdays. The final episode of\n                     season one will be available on April 25. Recording Your Visionary Podcast has been a rewarding experience for Brown, and one that has allowed him to share his positive outlook with his fellow students. In addition to the show, he also uses his writing to help inspire others. His recently self-published fifth book, The Positive Affirmation Guide, is about the power of pursuing one\u2019s dreams and always moving forward. Brown says the main goal of all his work is to encourage people to be \u201cintentional.\u201d \u201cThat means taking a step outside your current situation and figuring out what you want your life to look like,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people are stuck in the present and don\u2019t think about their futures. Once you have a vision, work backwards. Figure out what you can do today to get one step closer to where you want to be.\u201d Kennesaw State names recipients of 2023 Alumni Awards Kennesaw State economic impact climbs to more than $2 billion in 2022 Kennesaw State University MBA Students Explore Israel's Business Landscape Coles College Professor Provides Internship Opportunities for Local High School Students Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

Schedule a Wellness Coaching session for the following topics:\u2060 Emotional Well-being Based on your individual needs, Wellness Coaches will help you create a plan for emotional\n                                       well-being, which may include stress and time management, ways to increase motivation,\n                                       decrease isolation, build social support, and learn organizational skills. Healthy Eating Understand the basics of building healthy meals and snacks and developing strategies for healthy eating while on the go and on a budget.\u00a0 Physical Activity Being physically active can help improve your mood, energy level, and overall health.\n                                       Not only will you learn the benefits of physical activity, you will also learn about\n                                       cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength/endurance, flexibility, and how to incorporate\n                                       these components into your existing schedule for a lifetime of physical activity. Nicotine Cessation Wellness Coaches can help you make a plan for nicotine cessation from smoking, vaping,\n                                       or spit tobacco.

While their guidance will provide support and education, it is not a substitute for\n                     medical or psychological treatment.

I want to be able to help provide support for any student looking\n                                       for it. I like to practice positive self-care by taking long walks outside, listening to music,\n                                       and doing deep breathing exercises. A well-being tip I would share with other students is to remember to give yourself\n                                       a break sometimes! I've found that even just a few minutes at a time can be super\n                                       beneficial. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                    \n                                     Elementary Education I became a Wellness Coach because I am passionate about helping others. I am an advocate\n                                       for mental health and positivity amongst my peers. Being a Wellness Coach gives me\n                                       the opportunity to provide positive resources and support students and their needs\n                                       to achieve their goals. I practice positive self-care by dedicating a day during the week to rest and take\n                                       time to myself One well-being tip I would like to share is to always give yourself grace! As college students, we have so much on our plates, and it\u2019s easy for us to be hard on ourselves all the time, but it's important that we give ourselves grace and take things day by day and realize that we are doing our absolute best, even on the hard days. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                    \n                                      Psychology major I became a Wellness Coach because I am very passionate about promoting wellness and\n                                       self-care amongst people. Connecting with students through Wellness Coaching allows\n                                       me to help people towards achieving their goals while enjoying their journey along\n                                       the way. I practice positive self-care by journaling and meditation. Putting energy towards\n                                       having a positive mindset really makes a difference. One well-being tip I would like to share is to put time and energy into getting to\n                                       know yourself. We are constantly evolving as people, and being aware of your intentions,\n                                       limits, and goals can make certain aspects of life less stressful. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                    \n                                      Sociology I have centered my life around my well-being/wellness and I wanted the opportunity\n                                       to share my knowledge with my peers on how they can include wellness in their lives\n                                       too. I practice positive self-care by dedicating a few hours each day all to myself. \u00a0 I think the most important part about your wellbeing is being unapologetically yourself\n                                       and learning to love your uniqueness! \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                    \n                                      Psychology I love helping others reach their goals. I like to go to the gym, go on calm walks, and plan ahead so I don't get stressed. Take one day out of the week to focus on a hobby and relax. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                    \n                                      Integrated Health Science I've always been a proactive member when it came to community service, and this was another opportunity to engage in my college community to help and encourage students. I\u2019ve learned over the years how important it is to take care of yourself, and I love that I can share these ideas with others. I distance myself from negative energy or negative thoughts about myself. Also, I\n                                       try to think about the positive and take time for myself when I feel like I need it. Plan self-care days. You don't have to do anything extravagant like a spa or nails\n                                       but something that you enjoy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                    \n                                      Integrated Health Science I enjoy listening to others and as a new transfer student I wanted to be able to connect\n                                       with the campus. I practice self-care by meditating, journaling, and reading a good book. A wellbeing tip that I would like to share is going to the gym or taking a long walk on a nature trail for mental clarity.\u00a0 If you want to become a wellness coach, you can  .\u00a0 Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

A registered dietitian (RD)/registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) is a food and\n                                       nutrition expert who has met academic and professional requirements including: Recently, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics\u2019 Board of Directors and the Commission on Dietetic Registration approved the use of \u201cregistered dietitian nutritionist\u201d (RDN) by registered dietitians.

Dietitians can\n                                       be employed in a wide variety of settings, including: The terms \u201cregistered dietitian\u201d (RD) and \u201cregistered dietitian nutritionist\u201d are legally protected, just like a \u201cregistered nurse\u201d (RN) or a \u201cmedical doctor\u201d (MD). In order to use either title, an individual must complete specified academic and professional requirements and pass a board certified exam (see \"What is a registered dietitian/registered dietitian nutritionist\u201d). Unfortunately, some people abuse the term \u201cnutritionist\u201d and sell supplements or counsel people when they lack any specific education or training. Most states, including Georgia, require dietitians to be licensed if they provide nutrition counseling. When seeking nutrition services, always verify the provider is a registered dietitian (or registered dietitian nutritionist) through the Commission on Dietetic Registration of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and is licensed in the state they are practicing.

In addition to the costs to taxpayers and employers, friends and families spend time, money, and their emotional bandwidth in support of their loved ones facing addiction. Most costly of all is the expense to the individual who loses hopes and dreams, or worse, their life.\u00a0 The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that for every $1 invested into treatment, approximately $4-$7 are saved in societal costs. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration further estimates that every $1 invested in prevention could save as much as $18 in societal costs. But what about investing in the individuals who have successfully overcome their addictions?\u00a0 At Kennesaw State University\u2019s Center for Young Adult Addiction in Recovery, we see the transformation that occurs when people in recovery are given the opportunity to pursue their education. The societal costs are reduced, but more importantly, these students\u2019 hopes and dreams are re-invigorated. Their relationships with family and friends are healed. Like the other students graduating from Kennesaw State, students in recovery become valued and coveted professionals. \u00a0 We encourage you to invest in recovery. Whether you invest money, time, attention, mentorship, second chances, or whatever it is that you have to give \u2013 we know that investing in recovery will pay dividends.

Definition The Americans with Disabilities Act defines a service animal as \"any dog or miniature\n                                          horse that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of\n                                          an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual,\n                                          or other mental disability.\" The work or tasks performed by a service animal must be directly related to the handler's\n                                          disability. Examples of work or tasks include, but are not limited to: Federal and state law specifically excludes animals whose primary purpose is emotional\n                                          support, therapy, or comfort from the definition of service animal. Procedures Definition  An Emotional Support Animal (ESA) is one that can be kept in residence as prescribed\n                                          for a person with a disability as a reasonable accommodation to provide him/her an\n                                          equal opportunity to use and enjoy campus housing. Such requirement must be documented by a licensed medical and/or a mental health professional as needed due to one or more identified symptoms or effects of the person\u2019s disability. Typically, an emotional support animal is prescribed to an individual with a disability by a licensed physician with training in the area of the person\u2019s disability, who has treated the person with a disability for at least 6 months, and who can establish the nexus between the disability and the need for the emotional support animal.

Problems in self-regulatory behaviors, social perception,\n                                       and social interaction may exist with learning disabilities but do not, by themselves,\n                                       constitute a learning disability. Although learning disabilities may occur concomitantly\n                                       with other disabilities (e.g., sensory impairment, intellectual disability, serious\n                                       emotional disturbance), or with extrinsic influences (such as cultural differences,\n                                       insufficient or inappropriate instruction), they are not the result of those conditions\n                                       or influences. (National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities, Learning Disabilities:\n                                       Issues on Definition) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) AD/HD is a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that is more frequently displayed and more severe than is typically observed in individuals at a comparable level of development. By definition, the disorder is developmental in nature, and therefore, diagnosis requires the manifestation of several symptoms prior to age 12 years. Furthermore, a diagnosis of AD/HD is not sufficient, in and of itself, to determine appropriate accommodations. Therefore, objective data provided in a comprehensive assessment of cognitive processing and academic functioning may be required to establish the nature and severity of the student\u2019s functional limitations. Such data may include, but are not limited to, the following: rating scale information, performance on continuous performance tasks, cognitive processing test results, and/or the results of achievement tests. The ADHD Verification form can be provided to an evaluator to elicit information needed\n                                       to document ADHD. Please note that this verification form, although helpful in the\n                                       documentation of the diagnosis of ADHD, may not be sufficient by itself in determining\n                                       functional impairment. If this form is used, it is requested that the evaluator fills\n                                       out the form in its entirety and provides the functional impairment in the academic\n                                       setting. Autism Spectrum Disorders Autism Spectrum Disorders are characterized by impairment in several areas of development\n                                       including social communication and social interaction across contexts, and the presence\n                                       of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities. Acquired Brain Injuries Brain injury can result from external trauma, such as a closed head or an object penetration injury, or internal trauma, such as a cerebral vascular accident or tumor. Additionally, individuals may acquire brain impairment as a result of neurological illnesses, such as epilepsy or multiple sclerosis. ABI can cause physical, cognitive, emotional, social, and vocational changes that can affect an individual for a short period of time or permanently. Depending on the location and extent of the injury, symptoms can vary widely. Understanding functional changes after an injury and resulting implications for education are more important than only knowing the cause or type of injury.\u00a0 Psychological Disorders Many different psychological disorders can interfere with cognitive, emotional, and social functioning and may negatively impact a student\u2019s ability to function in an academic environment. Some individuals experience significant disruptions in mood, thinking, and behavioral regulation that are secondary to a psychological disorder. The symptoms and associated impairment may be either chronic or episodic. Complete descriptions and diagnostic criteria for psychological disorders are available in the current version of the DSM or ICD. Test anxiety by itself is not considered a psychological disorder. Sensory Disorders: Deaf and Hard of Hearing Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing experience a reduction in sensitivity\n                                       to sound. Amplification may not assist the individual in interpreting auditory stimuli.\n                                       Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing from birth may experience lags in the\n                                       development of speech and most often have language-based deficiencies. Sensory Disorders: Visual Disorders Visual impairments are disorders in the function of the eyes that cannot be adequately\n                                       corrected by medical or surgical intervention, therapy, or conventional eyewear. Individuals\n                                       with visual disorders may not have any usable vision or the vision may be significantly\n                                       limited. \u00a0 Mobility Disorders Mobility impairments refer to conditions that limit a person\u2019s coordination or ability to move. Some mobility impairments are congenital while others are the result of illness or physical injury. The functional abilities and limitations resulting from the impairment will vary from individual to individual. Systemic Disorders Systemic disabilities are conditions affecting one or more of the body\u2019s systems, including the respiratory, immunological, neurological, circulatory, or digestive systems. Systemic disabilities may change over time. Therefore, the need for - and type of - reasonable accommodations may require updated documentation. Communication Disorders\u00a0 Communication disorders is a general term that refers to a heterogeneous group of\n                                       disorders manifested by significant difficulties in language, speech and, communication.\n                                       This includes difficulties in receptive and expressive language, including the production\n                                       of sounds, articulation and fluency deficits, difficulty in the acquisition and production\n                                       of language across modalities (i.e., spoken, written), and difficulties in the social\n                                       use of verbal and nonverbal communication. Evaluation Referral and Documentation Review Process Your Disability Service Provider may consult with the RCLD\u00a0for documentation review\u00a0to determine whether or not the documentation meets USG requirements. When you come for your intake interview, you may be asked to sign a release to send your documentation to the RCLD for review and consultation purposes.\u00a0 If your documentation does not meet the University System of Georgia requirements,\n                                       or if you have never been tested for a learning disorder before, it is your responsibility\n                                       to obtain the additional testing/evaluation.

This includes missing classes, falling behind, doing poorly on exams, and overall lowered grades. Substance use on a college campus presents significant risk to the well-being of all college students, with implications stemming from academic troubles to actual death. Education is the key to reducing these risks. Education also offers the ability to alter the cultural norms of substance use and addiction; from challenging the dominant \u201cparty\u201d discourse, to reducing social stigma associated with addiction and recovery. Our education philosophy is twofold - we present recovery-informed knowledge to the\n                     collegiate population, and we advocate for cultural changes, on campus, and in the\n                     larger addiction treatment and recovery field.

How do I purchase my Meal Plan? If you live in on-campus housing, a Meal Plan is part of your on-campus room and board. Once Housing and Residence Life fees are applied to your student account, residential students receive a default Meal Plan based on your earned credit hours, and the cost is charged to your student account, which you can view on Owl Express.\u00a0 \u00a0 If you live off campus, purchasing a Meal Plan is easy through our mobile ordering\n                                       app. Please note that it will take 24 to 48 hours for a Meal Plan charge to appear\n                                       on your student account, but your Meal Plan is activated at the top of each hour if\n                                       the semester is in session. How do I check my unused balance? How do I add more entries or Dining Dollars to my Meal Plan? If your want to add more entries or Dining Dollars, it is easy to do through our mobile\n                                       ordering app. Keep in mind this will not take the place of your current plan but add\n                                       on to your current balance. Can I use my Meal Plan on both campuses? Can I use financial aid to pay for my Meal Plan? Will my Meal Plan carry over to the next semester? What is my Meal Plan used for? Meal Plan charges for both residents and commuters are used to support our award-winning\n                                       dining facilities. University Dining supports local businesses and food providers,\n                                       national retail brands and over 500 staff members to assure our residents and commuters\n                                       can focus on class, and not where they will get their next meal. Meal Plan charges\n                                       help maintain our facilities and purchase needed equipment to run our operations. If I live on campus, how do I know which plan I'll receive? Why is a Meal Plan necessary for residential students? Is the Meal Plan cost included in the Housing fee? How do I change my default Meal Plan? Can I cancel my Residential Meal Plan since I have a full kitchen in my unit? Can I apply for a Residential Meal Plan exemption?

SABAC reviews requests from qualified Registered Student Organizations (RSO) and Student Affairs departments with a direct student impact through programming, events, and activities and makes recommendations to the Vice President for Student. SABAC meets monthly throughout the fall and spring semesters to review event, promotional\n                     and travel requests as well as in April to review annual budget requests. More detailed\n                     info including the meetings schedule can be found on the SABAC  .

KSU recognizes and is committed to upholding the First Amendment rights of all individuals, including the right to freedom of speech, academic freedom, and peaceable assembly. The KSU campus community is free to share ideas and opinions, even those that some might find offensive. Ideas and opinions should be openly and freely debated and discussed, both inside and outside the classroom, without fear of suppression or reprisal. KSU promotes such intellectual debates and upholds the values of civility and mutual respect in such debates. KSU also recognizes its responsibility to promote campus safety, to ensure the proper functioning of the academic environment and institution activities, and to further other important institution objectives without unduly burdening the free expression rights of students, faculty, and staff.\u00a0 When used throughout this policy, the terms \u201cexpressive activity\u201d and \u201cexpression\u201d include non - commercial speech and activities protected by the First Amendment, including speeches, performances, demonstrations, marches, protests, picketing, and the distribution of non- commercial literature. Commercial speech is regulated by KSU solicitation policies. Demonstrations and assembly can be valid expression for all opinions, including dissenting opinions, provided that the demonstration or assembly does not disrupt academic and administrative functions of the University. KSU affirms its commitment to the First Amendment rights of those on its campuses even though the language or ideals of those seeking a venue for free expression may contradict University ideals or the personal views of KSU students and employees. Individuals or groups of people who are not members of the campus community may only engage in expressive activity on KSU\u2019s campus in accordance with Section D of this policy. For purposes of this policy, the \u201cKSU campus community\u201d means students, faculty, staff, and their invited guests. For members of the KSU campus community, the unrestricted outdoor areas of campus are deemed public forums and venues for expression. Restricted outdoor areas of campus include, but are not limited to: the KSU Sports and Recreation Park, Fifth Third Bank Stadium, Bailey Athletic Complex, Campus Entry Lawn, S. Walter Kelly Sr. Memorial Field, athletic fields, parking lots and decks, and active campus construction areas. The designation of public forum areas herein may not be used to prohibit the KSU campus community from engaging in expressive activities consistent with this policy elsewhere on campus. The policy does not apply to University-sponsored activities or indoor areas. Rather, the policy only sets forth reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on campus expression; and it establishes, as designated public forums, certain outdoor areas of KSU\u2019s campus and sets forth requirements for forum reservations in the following limited circumstances: (1) KSU students, faculty or staff who plan an event with 30 or more persons and (2) individuals or groups who are not members of the KSU community who wish to speak on KSU\u2019s campus. By placing reasonable limitations on time, place, and manner of speech, KSU does not take into consideration or take a position on the content or viewpoint of the expression, but allows for a diversity of viewpoints to be expressed in an academic setting. While all the unrestricted outdoor areas of campus are deemed public forums and venues for expression for members of the KSU campus community, KSU has also designated the following highly visible locations as public forums on KSU\u2019s campus (\u201cDesignated Campus Areas\u201d): These Designated Campus Areas are generally available to the KSU campus community\n                     from 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., provided that they have not previously been reserved.\n                     They are available to individuals or groups not enrolled at or employed by KSU from\n                     9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, provided that they have not previously\n                     been reserved. The Designated Campus Areas are closed for the first full week of classes\n                     and final exam weeks of each semester. This policy does not apply to the reservation\n                     of indoor facilities, which is governed by procedures set forth at  Reservations will only be processed on days that KSU\u2019s Administrative Offices are open for business (\u201cuniversity business days\u201d). Though reservations to use the Designated Campus Areas are only required as set forth in Section C and Section D below, KSU recommends that all parties interested in utilizing the Designated Campus Areas submit a completed Reservation Request Form to KSU\u2019s Office of the Dean of Students prior to use so that KSU may minimize scheduling conflicts, accommodate all interested users, and provide adequate security for the speaker and the audience. Individuals or groups of people who are not enrolled at or employed by KSU may only engage in expressive activity on KSU\u2019s campus in the Designated Campus Areas and only after submitting a completed Reservation Request Form to KSU\u2019s Office of the Dean of Students at least four (4) university business days prior to the scheduled speech and obtaining approval for such use in writing from a Student Affairs official pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section E below. Organizers are encouraged to submit their requests as early in the planning stages of the event as possible. This provision does not apply to KSU invited Classroom Visitors or to any University- sponsored events. Completed Reservation Request Forms (available at  ) should be submitted to KSU\u2019s Office of the Dean of Students in person or by email to   at least four university business days prior to the scheduled event. Reservation\n                     scheduling will be coordinated by a Student Affairs official, who will schedule forums\n                     for expression on a first-come, first-served basis. The Student Affairs official must\n                     respond to all requests in writing as soon as practicable, but in no event more than\n                     two university business days following receipt of the request, either authorizing\n                     the reservation and noting any special instructions, if applicable, or setting forth\n                     the reason for denial of the reservation. The Student Affairs official may only deny\n                     a reservation request for one of the following reasons: To allow for a diversity of viewpoints to be expressed, if an individual or group\n                     has three (3) or more reservations confirmed within a calendar month, the individual\n                     or group may not submit an additional reservation request for that calendar month\n                     until four (4) University business days prior to the requested reservation date. If,\n                     at that time, the additional reservation request conflicts with that of another individual\n                     or group (i.e., seeks to reserve the same location at the same time) that does not\n                     already have three (3) or more reservations confirmed within that calendar month,\n                     the reservation request of the other individual or group shall have priority. When assessing a reservation request, the Student Affairs official must not consider\n                     or impose restrictions based on the content or viewpoint of the expression, including\n                     the possible reaction to the content or viewpoints anticipated to be expressed during\n                     the event. The Designated Campus Area(s) is not reserved until the requestor receives\n                     an email confirmation from the Student Affairs official, which shall contain the name\n                     of the event; the date, time, and location of the event; and the name of the individual\n                     making the reservation request. Any denial of a reservation request in whole or in part may be appealed to KSU\u2019s Vice President for Student Affairs in writing setting forth the reasons why the appeal should be granted. KSU\u2019s Vice President for Student Affairs or designee must respond to the appeal in writing within two university business days. The decision of KSU\u2019s Vice President of Student Affairs or designee is final. In addition to the requirements set forth above, all individuals expressing themselves on KSU\u2019s campus must comply with the following provisions: Authorization of a speech, event, or demonstration is contingent upon compliance with the criteria listed above. The authorized representative of the speaker or group is required to sign a form acknowledging compliance with these administrative procedures and guidelines and acknowledging that the University will not be held responsible for the actions of participants in the expression. Additionally, the authorized representative must sign a form acknowledging agreement to make restitution for any litter or property damage that is caused by the representative\u2019s speaker or group. KSU Public Safety and other appropriate administrators will be notified upon receipt\n                     of the reservation request. The reservation request is a public record and submitted\n                     requests will be released to interested parties in accordance with the terms of the\n                     Georgia Open Records Act. The University reserves the right to refuse to permit individuals or groups to assemble,\n                     demonstrate, protest, or otherwise express themselves in the Designated Campus Areas\n                     if the individual or group refuses to abide by these administrative procedures and\n                     guidelines.

The preferred method for non-emergency\n                     reporting is the Red Flag/BRT online report site. This is a secure method of reporting.\n                     It has the added benefit of asking for specific information that is helpful for the\n                     BRT when following up on your concerns. For extreme distress, and concerns for immediate safety, contact KSU Public Safety\n                     immediately at 470-578-6666. When in doubt, REPORT! Many roles at the university legally require reporting of concerns\n                     to university officials and submitting a BRT report satisfies that requirement. It\n                     is always better to be cautious and help someone in need than fail to act and risk\n                     crisis. Examples of Items to Report to the BRT After A Report is Submitted After submitting a report, a member of the BRT will follow up with you to address\n                     any additional questions or concerns. The BRT will review the case and determine the\n                     most appropriate response on a case by case basis given the totality of information\n                     available to the BRT at the time. Responses can vary from supportive outreach to the\n                     individual to make the person aware of resources, making a referral to an appropriate\n                     university office for further action, or continued monitoring. Any action taken by\n                     the BRT is done collaboratively and under the auspices of the appropriate office or\n                     professionals with the underlying intention of creating a culture of safety, support\n                     and care.

For mild to moderate concerns, attempt to talk with the student, preferably away from other students, and do not promise confidentiality. Express your concerns directly, be clear about classroom expectations, and ensure that the student is aware of campus resources. If warranted, encourage the student to make an appointment with the Counseling Center, Health Center, Women\u2019s Resource and Interpersonal Violence Center, Veterans Resource Center, and/or other supportive offices on campus. Behavior that disrupts the learning and/or living environment is a violation of the KSU Code of Conduct and a report should be filed with the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity.

And I'm a senior biology major at KSU in the College of Science and Mathematics. I serve as the College of Science and Mathematics Senator through Student Government Association.\u00a0 The best things that have ever happened to me at KSU are the connections I've made and how involved I've gotten on campus. I feel like it's really rewarding knowing that the work I'm putting in at KSU by volunteering at different organizations is having an effect on the broader KSU community. For example, in my student organization, Adopt-a-Stream, we conduct water quality testing every month. And we report that data back to the state of Georgia, which then helps them monitor the quality of our water in Cobb County. That's one way that I volunteer on campus. And it's really rewarding knowing that that data is being used for something else and helping the community.\u00a0 My favorite thing about KSU is the diverse campus and the resources KSU has for students, and also the dining hall The Commons. \u00a0 ! I like it because it's a huge database of all the organizations on campus and the departments. And you can read all about the organizations on Owl Life and even join them on there.\u00a0 \n                      \n                   Aside from serving as the Senator for the College of Science and Mathematics through\n                     the  , I love doing that because I've met so many new people and made so many connections\n                     that are, hopefully, going to help me get into medical school. I also started a new\n                     registered student organization (RSO) at KSU called  . That process was really smooth because I had great resources from the   Department.

It's a pre-med organization, pre Health Organization, on campus.

I'm also an ambassador for the  , where I volunteer at different tables where they do AOD tables and share alcohol and other drug information. I recently participated in an event with CYAAR called Love Your Body Week, where we had this huge event called Smash the Scale. It was a successful event where we told the students to smash the stigma of defining ourselves with our weight because we spread body positivity at KSU. I love being involved on campus because it just helps you meet a lot of new people. Again, connections matter.\u00a0 When I graduate from KSU, I want to have this place where I look back on my alma mater\n                     and know all these people. \n                      \n                   Kennesaw State names Marcy Stidum to assistant vice president role for student affairs Study rooms and how to book them Student Affairs awards ceremony recognizes outstanding students and student groups Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

Each caterer has specific guidelines to the menu and service details, final confirmation,\n                     and headcount policies. Please visit the caterer's provided webpage for a detailed\n                     list of these policies. KSU Hospitality Services can act as a liaison between the\n                     selected caterer and the KSU contact to assist with completing the ordering process\n                     if requested. Departments are responsible for processing all invoices and ensuring\n                     timely payment to the vendor. The use of catering providers not included on the Approved Contracted Caterers list will require KSU Hospitality Services approval. Complete the\u00a0 to initiate the review and approval process. Please include all the requested documents and a copy of the quote received when submitting\n                     the Secondary External Catering Request Form. All requests are based on the approval\n                     or denial of Hospitality Services and evaluated on a case-by-case basis.    Food must not require set up and/or on-site service (e.g. chafers, heating sources,\n                     banquet attendants, servers, etc.) and must not be a temperature controlled food item\n                     to qualify as meal delivery or pick up. Food that requires temperature maintenance\n                     cannot be served as full service catering must be acquired. An example of acceptable items would be pizza or sandwich delivery, food from a fast-food\n                     vendor and cold or dry snacks from any supermarket. An approval request is not necessary\n                     for food delivery or pick up, however submission of the Catering Services Confirmation\n                     Form including the quote or order form is required. When departments, Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) or guests order and pay\n                     for food delivery, inline with the previously stated guidelines, and the food delivered\n                     is consumed within one hour of delivery time, it is considered drop-off service, not\n                     catering. It is against Kennesaw State University policy to allow anyone who is not a licensed\n                     vendor to prepare food that will be served for consumption on campus. Therefore, potlucks\n                     are strictly prohibited. This excludes the use of food delivery or pick up (see above). Due to health regulations, leftovers cannot be removed from any event space. This\n                     policy is strictly enforced.

Due to health regulations, leftovers cannot be removed from any event space, for any reason.

The Democracy Wall is also a space to encourage idea-generation for proactive change \u2013 on campus, in the local community, and across the globe. \n                                 Democracy Wall Ground Rules\n                                  The Democracy Wall and these guidelines are based on the Democracy Plaza created on the Indianapolis campus of IUPUI over a decade ago, which has stood as a national model for democratic engagement and civic dialogue.\u00a0 Kennesaw State University has borrowed with permission elements of the IUPUI model, and will administer compliance with the law based on consultation with KSU Legal Affairs and KSU Public Safety, and compliance with university codes of conduct based on consultation with Student Conduct and Academic Integrity.\u00a0 The boards are cleaned every other Friday (or the next available business day if the university is closed on the designated Friday) to allow for a fresh round of conversations.

The Office of Sustainability has been hard at work, collaborating with students, faculty,\n                     and staff to promote sustainability on campus and reduce our carbon footprint. Here\n                     are some event highlights from the past year: 1.   Created opportunities for students across both campuses to share their understanding, concerns and ideas around sustainability on campus and changes that can be made to improve campus engagement and overall college life.\u00a0 \u00a0 2.   Our Office hosted a Friday at the Food Forest for Universities across Georgia to learn about some of our upcoming sustainability efforts at Kennesaw State University as well as tour their Campus to build connections and learn from each other. These tours were related to their student body engagement as well as their facilities operations.\u00a0 \u00a0 3.  The coffee grounds for some of your favorite shops on campus are now composting coffee grounds and leftover products to prevent them from being taken to the landfill. Due to the number of students and staff that order coffee on campus daily, the amount being redirected to composting is without a doubt making an impact even in its early stage.\u00a0 4.   Helped engineering students implement sustainable designs as a required goal for the annual pumpkin launch. This interaction allows students to see the ethical side of their degree choices early on. After the competition materials were collected and re-used for our ASCE Competition team. The test pumpkins were donated to a local chicken farm to ensure nothing was wasted.\u00a0 5.   Our very own KSU Field Station provides food for our dining hall under a contract where they purchase what they want throughout the year. To allow students to purchase these items as well we developed the Field Station Market where we sold these items to students on campus every Thursday. In combination with providing fresh produce, we enlightened our campus body on the importance of closed loop consumerism and how much of an impact it can have on our economy and carbon emissions.\u00a0 \u00a0 6.   After Implementing our multi-stream recycling bins across campus we launched our own recycle right campaign to educate the community on the streams and what we are accepting on campus as well has how to ensure you are recycling properly no matter where you are.\u00a0 \u00a0 7.  We took a trip to Re:Loom to learn about their operation to keep all types of discarded\n                     fabrics away from the landfills to reuse the material. This in return conserves a\n                     lot of money and electrical energy during their production process while also creating\n                     a rehabilitation aid by providing jobs and experiences for women seeking more opportunities\n                     after having drastic change in their own lives. \u00a0 8.   The Purpose and explanation of each goal was explained to help students, faculty, staff, and the community understand the importance of the goals and how they can contribute to them with small personal changes if they were not already doing so.\u00a0 9.  In partnership with Georgia Tech, Georgia State, and University of Georgia we hosted a casual networking event for students to connect with collegiate professionals. Building these core connections in sustainability are pertinent to our success as an office but even more so for our students. \u00a0\u00a0 10.   The Office held its first official Observance of Earth Week, establishing our presence on both campuses with interactive fairs and events for the student body to enjoy. We hosted spaces for sustainable RSO\u2019s and local businesses, some owned by Alumni, to interact with a larger audience and create influential discussions about the future of sustainability in consumerism and on campus. \u00a0 \n                      \n                   \u00a0 11.  We finished off the semester by collecting old clothing and unopened food you deemed admissible but no longer served you as you moved home for the summer. The Swap Shop initiative was to make moving out easier for students and prevent these items from going to the landfill as they usually do.\u00a0 Overall, this year has been a success for our college's sustainability efforts. We\n                     are proud of the progress we have made and look forward to continuing our efforts\n                     to reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainable practices in the coming years.\n                     We would like to thank everyone in the college community for their continued support\n                     and commitment to sustainability. Together, we can make a positive impact on our environment\n                     and create a more sustainable future. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

In Fall, 2017, KSU Geography Professor Jason Rhodes and KSU students launched a collaborative\n                              research project with Sociology, Professor Shahidur Rahman and students, at BRAC University\n                              in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Together, students worked to plan interviews with garment workers.\n                              At first, it was difficult to find garment workers who felt safe discussing the true\n                              conditions they worked in because the interviews were arranged by factory managers\n                              and took place on the factory premises. This changed when we discovered the , an organization with over 40,000 members that works to advance the rights of garment\n                     workers in Bangladesh. Once in touch with AWAJ foundation, we were able to connect\n                     with workers who were eager to tell their stories. The students at BRAC continue to\n                     conduct interviews with garment workers and translate them from Bengali to English.\n                     Some of these interviews available to read below.

The Office\n                              of Sustainability has rolled out over 100 bins between Marietta and Kennesaw campuses\n                              to step up our recycling efforts at the University. Our old bins collected all of our recycling in one place, which meant that if one\n                              recycling stream was contaminated, they all were. This made it difficult to recycle\n                              the materials efficiently, and often times they ended up in the landfill. But our new bins are designed to help sort our recycling into separate streams, keeping\n                              it cleaner and easier to recycle. This means that it can be used more efficiently\n                              in producing new materials and products. While the new bins make it easier to recycle, they still depend on you to make sure\n                              we divert as much waste as possible from the landfill. If you're not sure if something\n                              is recyclable or where it goes, don't worry! Our new Clean River bins have labels\n                              to help you out. Paper Plastics Cans Compost \u00a0 \n                                  \n                               \u00a0 While the inclusion of glass in the regular recycling bins on campus is not suitable,\n                                 it is important to recognize that glass holds significant value as a recyclable material.\n                                 It can be effectively repurposed into new bottles, jars and even fiberglass insulation.\n                                 To contribute to glass recycling efforts, a large purple container is available at\n                                 3305 Busbee Dr NW, Kennesaw, GA 30144. \u00a0 You can find the glass recycling container situated in the front parking lot at the\n                                 corner closest to the town center park-and-ride lot. Note: when depositing glass items\n                                 for recycling, there is no requirement to segregate them by color. However, it is\n                                 essential that the items are completely empty and thoroughly cleaned. Several locations on campus are equipped with larger cardboard recycling bins, identifiable\n                        by the cardboard logo displayed on them. These bins serve the purpose of preventing\n                        our paper bins from filling up too rapidly. They are designated for the disposal of\n                        cardboard and clean pizza boxes. KSU generated over 1,800 tons of waste (3.7 million pounds) over the 2015 school year, an average of 110 pounds per student. Of the waste generated, KSU diverted 49% (915 tons) from the landfill through recycling and composting.\u00a0 See below to learn more about KSU\u2019s current waste minimization and waste diversion strategies. Waste Minimization Waste Diversion KSU\u2019s composting program helps to divert waste from landfills and return nutrients to the soil. Read below to find out how and what to compost on campus. Compostable Non-Compostable The Office of Sustainability also offers a short compost training session to departments,\n                                    classes, or student organizations. If you'd like to request a training or have questions\n                                    about KSU's composting program, please email us at recycle@kenesaw.edu. What is composting? Why is composting important? Food Waste is a big issue across the globe and here on campus. The UN Food & Agriculture\n                                                      Organization estimates that 1/3 of all edible food globally is lost or wasted. In\n                                                      2019, a food waste audit was preformed at the commons and found that enough edible\n                                                      food is left on plates in 1 day to feed a family of four for almost 3 months. In 2018, over 35 billion tons of food were sent to landfills in the United States.\n                                                      When food waste and other organic material is buried in landfills it produces methane.\n                                                      Methane is a GHG that is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping\n                                                      heat in the atmosphere. By composting we return nutrients and minerals to the soil to help our plants grow\n                                                      better. Composting also helps prevent the creation of methane. Where can I compost on campus? Why can't I compost biodegradable items? What is a coated paper product? Can I compost these same items at home? \u00a0 This year marks a significant milestone for our community as we introduce the first-ever recycling program for on-campus housing. As responsible stewards of the environment, we have a collective duty to protect our planet and reduce our ecological footprint. Recycling is a simple yet effective way to conserve resources, reduce waste, and curb pollution. By recycling plastic bottles & jugs (plastics #1 & #2) and metal cans, we can take a significant step towards a greener campus.\u00a0 Getting started with recycling is a breeze! You can sign out a pre-labeled recycling\n                           bin from the Housing Office at UVS 6000. These bins come equipped with handles, making\n                           it a breeze to carry your recyclables to the North Campus Recycling Center. While signing out a bin is encouraged, if you prefer to use your own container, that's absolutely fine. Just ensure you're recycling the right materials correctly.\u00a0 It's essential to understand what can and cannot be recycled. Here's a quick guide\n                           to help you: \u00a0 When your recycling bin is full, bring it to the North Campus Recycling Center near\n                           UVS 4000. Remember, it's essential to sort your plastic bottles & jugs into the red\n                           bins and metal cans into the yellow bins. Keep items loose and not in bags to avoid\n                           recycling contamination and ensure proper recycling. If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to learn more about the recycling\n                           program, feel free to visit the UVS 6000 Housing Office or drop us an email at  . Your feedback matters to us, and we're committed to continually improving our recycling\n                           efforts. There are five Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs) conveniently located across both campuses.\n                           These innovative machines make recycling cans and bottles easier than ever before.\n                           Plus, every time you recycle at one of these five machines, 5 cents will be donated\n                           to KSU's CARE Services.

This space serves as a hub for all first-gen student resources at the university. \u00a0KSU has a vibrant community of first-gen students, faculty, and staff who contribute much to the curricular and co-curricular life of the campus. African American Male Initiative (AAMI) ASCEND Scholars Call Me Mister Strategic Outreach and Diversity Initiatives (SODI) To be a first-generation college student (or \"first-gen\") means that neither of your parents/guardians ever attained a four-year college degree. \u00a0Because this definition varies at times and can be relatively vague, KSU allows its students to identify themselves as first-gen.\u00a0 Regardless, there are many dedicated resources available to first-gen students at KSU, and this site is meant to showcase all of these - whether it's dedicated programming, involvement opportunities, housing options, or anything else. \u00a0There are plenty of opportunities and resources out there for our first-gen students to take advantage of! \u00a0The links below will direct you out to some of these, providing first a short description of what purpose each entity serves. Coca-Cola Scholars The Coca-Cola First Generation and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Scholars program (Coca-Cola Scholars Program) is a scholarship program designed to provide financial assistance and student support services to a select group of first-generation students. This program does have limitations, so be sure to read through the details on their site.\u00a0 Cultural & Community Centers (CCC) Located within the Division of Student Affairs, CCC serves as home to a vibrant array\n                                             of programs and services that focus on academic enrichment, campus and community engagement,\n                                             and cultural and identity exploration for all KSU students. CCC is in the process\n                                             of creating dedicated resources for first-gen students. Learning Communities (LC) An LC consists of 20-25 first-semester students who co-enroll in two or more courses that are linked together with a common theme (here, being first-gen). Courses are taught by faculty dedicated to working together to help KSU\u2019s newest students achieve academic success and a sense of belonging at the university. Living-Learning Communities (LLC) LLCs at KSU establish a greater connection and sense of engagement in the on-campus\n                                             housing experience. The first-gen program is developed to provide a supportive environment\n                                             for these students to engage with the campus community and their peers while they\n                                             learn how to navigate the college experience. There are multiple registered student organizations (RSOs) either dedicated specifically to or with areas that focus on the first-gen student population. \u00a0As student-operated organizations, they offer great opportunities for you to get involved on campus, build your leadership and professional skills, and improve your community. \u00a0Remember -- you get out of student involvement as much as you put into it, so take advantage and get involved!\u00a0 First-Gen Owls (FGO) FGO seeks to develop its members personally and professionally throughout their college experience by building interpersonal skills, connections, and member sense of belonging.\u00a0 Although it focuses on first-gen students, FGO is open to all students -- first-gen or not.

For starters, if you could please\n                     tell us about yourself, an introduction - about your career - and how you have met\n                     and treated garments workers. I am Dr. Ratu Rumana Binte Rahman. I worked as Professor of Gynecology at Sir Salimullah Medical College. Now after going into retirement, I am practicing\u00a0in a private (non-government) medical college. When I used to work at Sir Salimullah Medical - that was on the bank of the Buriganga river - and now I'm working on the bank of the Turag river. At East-West Medical College I am working as Professor of Gynecology, as well as Academic Director.\u00a0\u00a0\n                      \n                   How far have you come in contact with garments workers or treated them as patients\n                     or- : They used to come there, to Sir Salimullah Medical College, but more of them come\u00a0\u00a0here - here at East-West Medical College. There are more garments factories by the Turag River - at Ashulia - because there are a lot of garments factories in Ashulia so - well, garments workers come in with all kinds of problems - a lot of garments factories in Ashulia - in this area - so what I see here is - the problems that It happens because the garments workers beside the Turag - No, this happens more because of the dense population or - living in unhygienic conditions\n                     - dense population is also a - Yes. Their living conditions, that is also a factor. This is also for their poor personal hygiene or for living in densely populated areas\n                     and they do not have high living standards for these reasons they can get Pelvic Inflammatory\n                     Disease. Apart from that, Again, From what we can see and read, sometimes even watch on TV, about the working conditions of the garment factory working conditions, and how difficult they are - from a doctor's perspective - would you talk about these working conditions and how it impacts their health?\u00a0 \n                      \n                   Personal hygiene comes into play here and of course working conditions as well because\n                     where they have to work, there is inadequate ventilation. Then they - there's a lot\n                     of dust. No matter where they work in the factory, they have to work through the dust,\n                     a whole lot of it. But in order to prevent the dust - the measures that can be taken\n                     - they don't have much idea about those, so they end up not taking them. As a result,\n                     through their breathing they can contract airborne diseases quite easily. and they - they have to work right from dawn to dusk and for this prolonged period\n                     of time they'll use, say, just one sanitary pad or just one - they tend to use cloth\n                     - just one of those for the whole day. They might not even have the facilities to\n                     change it or anything and - their menstrual hygiene is just really bad. So they end\n                     up having more reproductive diseases - more diseases of the reproductive tract. : If someone works in a garments factory like this, then what kind on injuries may\n                     they be susceptible to while working - how probable are they and what are they like\n                     - and - what kind of on-the-job injuries might doctors see, what would they have to\n                     treat? So the needle or other cutting equipment might cause injuries for them. Apart from\n                     that, in some factories there are medical officers present on site, I've talked to\n                     one of them and they say that they - say someone is pregnant, they'll give them antenatal\n                     checkups - this is more recent though, as in what I see nowadays, I did not see this\n                     previously. They'll give monthly checkups to the pregnant girls - apart from that,\n                     other than OB/GYN problems, what I see is - they mostly come in with injuries. Injuries\n                     caused by cutting materials, basically, is what they come in with. Right? I mean apart\n                     from that - something else that can happen is - in their factories - in case of emergency - like\n                     fires - sometimes there maybe won't even be a real fire - there will be rumors and\n                     then chaos will ensue. As a result of this - maybe they have really narrow stairs\n                     or the stairs are blocked because of all the people - in this situation someone may\n                     just jump off, some try to rush down narrow stairs and then - a stampede basically\n                     - and someone falls underneath it all, they might come in with such injuries. And\n                     if there is a real fire, then they'll have burns or respiratory tract problems because\n                     of all the smoke. They'll come in with problems like that and well, those are serious\n                     injuries. Okay. In your experience, what is the age range that you see of the garments workers who come to you?\u00a0 \n                      \n                   Their ages range right from being teenagers to around 50 years or so - for the women.\n                     The women are in their teens to around 50 years of age or so is what I see. So that means - Mostly teenagers, though. . The age they enter the industry and the age they leave - could you say? They enter... usually in their teens they\u2019ll enter the workforce. After that maybe, who continues for how long - some might stop working after they get married, some might continue even after getting married. Again, maybe someone got divorced after marriage and then joined afterwards - Everyone doesn't necessarily enter the industry at the same age. So, over time - you say they start from their teens right up until they're 50 - so, Someone in their teens - and then over time - RR: Their injuries that they get from working with their tools and equipment - those\n                     don't change in nature. Those don't depend upon their age. But the gynecological problems,\n                     those tend to differ with age. For example, , because of those problems, we see with the bone right here - the pelvic bone - that\n                     they have problems like obstruction during childbirth and delivery. I mean, the delivery-related\n                     problems, if she were even a normal homemaker of a similar age or economic condition,\n                     she wouldn't have had to face this many problems, but she suffers from malnourishment\n                     more so - Apart from these, like I said before, , for teens up until - there's also violence , yes. I mean violence by their husbands. I mean, home - what is it called? They are the victims of so much domestic violence. So much. Yes, I really don't understand\n                     this - they are working women, they have their own income. Even then I see a lot -\n                     many of them being a victim of domestic violence. Maybe one is pregnant, she comes\n                     in and says that the baby won't move. Why? Their husband kicked them. But, I mean,\n                     for some reason they are subjected to so much domestic violence. Would you say that many garment factory workers leave the industry because they are\n                     physically no longer able to maintain the pace of work? Is it common for workers to\n                     leave the industry with chronic illness or injury that makes it difficult for them\n                     to find alternative employment? One reason I see for them leaving their jobs is childbirth - at the time of delivery\n                     they leave the job. Also, when they face the issues of who will look after the child\n                     and take care of it, that is when they leave the job. And if they contract any chronic diseases - basically for these reasons I see them\n                     leave their jobs. And - What kind of chronic illnesses do they contract? And how do they get them from the\n                     workplace? Oh well, from the workplace - it's all related really, even if not directly, it is\n                     indirectly. For example, They can get affected anywhere in the body and - Because they have decreased immunity. , so they can get chronic infections anywhere. As a result, I see a lot of them not\n                     being able to cope with work anymore, so they have to leave. Occupationally, right, and - so they have problems like asthma, and similar chronic diseases of the\n                     respiratory tract like chronic bronchitis and asthma. I'll get patients like, both them husband and wife, both of them working in the same\n                     factory, After the baby is born, the husband doesn't leave his job but the wife does.\n                     Because where else will she leave her child to go to work, and this is a reason for\n                     many of them losing their jobs. Do they contract such kinds of diseases that make it difficult for them to find other\n                     work in the future too? Yes. Because of these chronic debilitating diseases, it becomes harder to find work\n                     for them- and if they don't have physical fitness, they won't find work in the future\n                     either. Are employers held responsible for injury and illness caused by factory work? And,\n                     you said before how there is often a doctor on-site, apart from this, what kind of\n                     healthcare is available to them? A medical officer is often there, this much I know. They are also given medicine,\n                     those who are expecting are given iron tablets, that too I don't think is the norm\n                     everywhere, just some places. Some places give these workers this kind of cheap medicine. Are these paid for by the government or - No, no. So their employers then? Yes, from their employers. That too not in all factories. I have one or two colleagues\n                     who work there part-time and they tell me that some medicine is provided. And... what\n                     they say the most is that, if there were provisions for something like a daycare,\n                     so that someone could look after their kids, they could continue working. Another\n                     thing is, they work inhumanly hard. Sometimes they'll try and get me to write a false\n                     prescription or certificate. They'll ask me, \"Madam, please prescribe seven days of\n                     rest for me\". That particular illness might not require seven whole days of rest,\n                     maybe two days would suffice. But they work so inhumanly hard that they think if a\n                     doctor writes down a few more days of rest, it would help a bit. \n                      \n                   For these problems of theirs, is their employer ever held responsible? Employers don't always take notice about these because - well, very recently, I had\n                     a patient, In the process, I realized how her colleagues, the other employees, tried so hard\n                     to secure enough money to pay for the operation from their employer. Now, the money\n                     was raised, the operation happened, but now - she's a cancer patient, she has so many\n                     more expenses to come - she needed chemotherapy, so I referred her to the cancer hospital\n                     [referring to the National Institute of Cancer and Hospital] where the treatment costs\n                     would be much lower - minimal compared to a private hospital. So one day later, one\n                     of her colleagues came in and I asked her if the other girl (the cancer patient) went\n                     to the cancer hospital - I did her surgery, but she can't get the chemotherapy after. Because she can't get\n                     off from work, but also the minimum costs she would need - she can't secure that either.\n                     Maybe this isn't applicable in all cases, but where this young girl worked, it was\n                     the case. So the girl got treatment, but half of it. She couldn't get the chemotherapy\n                     after all. In terms of worker safety, have there been significant improvements made since the\n                     Rana Plaza tragedy of 2013? What improvements still need to be made? Whether it has been significant or not, I don't think so, but some improvements have\n                     been made. Some things have happened. For example, after the Rana Plaza incident they\n                     can come to us now. If the medical officer on site isn't enough, they are referred\n                     to us. This, I didn't see before the Rana Plaza incident. You know how I talked about\n                     the medical officers, well if the problems are under their jurisdiction they don't\n                     refer them to us, but if specialist treatment is required, in that case, they do,\n                     and the worker gets that day off, so they can go and see the specialist. But this\n                     is still insufficient, and the reason is, suppose I see them today and tell them I\n                     need to run some tests tomorrow morning and they have to be on an empty stomach -\n                     That's it. That is something they can't do. \"No, madam, I've only got the one day\n                     off, they won't give me time off again tomorrow morning.\" I mean, it's just, insufficient.\n                     It's an improvement from before, but it's still not enough. What more improvement could be done - Improvements - a person can't be treated in a single day. Suppose someone comes today,\n                     I'll need to take their blood sugar, but they've already come on a full stomach. I\n                     need to take their blood sugar in the morning on an empty stomach. But they won't\n                     get tomorrow morning off of work in order to come in. Then I'll need to follow up.\n                     Maybe the next day I'll need to do an ultrasound, maybe an injection the day after\n                     that, but they won't be able to continue their own treatment. What has improved from\n                     before is that the medical officer on site can now see to them and refer them to us\n                     if need be - this referral system is an improvement, but treatment needs to be consistent\n                     and that doesn't end up happening. \n                      \n                   As a doctor, what else do you think the industry could do to bring some change? Well, the medical officer understands when they should refer a case to us, these referred\n                     cases - it has to be ensured that the entire course or term of treatment for them\n                     is completed, then that will be a good thing. They do what they have to do up to the\n                     referral, but after the referral they have to go through a course of treatment, right? , or - they can't continue the treatment for whatever reason - financial troubles\n                     - or they simply can't be present. Because if they don't show up to work, they don't\n                     get paid, which is an important reason. So since they don't get paid if they don't\n                     show up to work, they come in for that one day, and as soon as they feel a little\n                     better, they rejoin work and don't come back. Coming to the next question, I've heard of some. I can't recall any specific names right now but I have heard of\n                     one or two of them. What kind of work do you know them to do? T For firing them over no apparent reason and what not, they see to matters like this.\n                     It is a female lawyers organization, I believe. [Unconfirmed] Ok, well so far we\u2019ve been talking about the impact of garment factory employment on the health of factory employees. If you don't build these factories in a properly planned way, then whatever problems\n                     are supposed to happen will happen. And most of them are unplanned. As a result of\n                     this, the problems that happen are - the factories' waste management isn't right so\n                     - the environment gets polluted. So what you get is, Air pollution. Water pollution. \n                      \n                   They often don't have enough water, or good bathing facilities, waste management isn't\n                     right, and due to these conditions, the number of health problems that they can cause\n                     all happen to the people who live there. And, what did you say? About the local people?\n                     Well, yes, and basically, around the factories you will always find a kind of slum\n                     And in these slums, since workers sometimes live here, well, either they have land,\n                     or sometimes grab land for setting up those living areas - and they offer these places\n                     to other people as well, for low rent. Because of this, these areas also see an increased\n                     tendency of social crimes being committed. No, we don't. But, they do exist. These kinds of organizations, they do exist, and\n                     we sometimes hear about what they do, Okay, we're nearing the end so now, this interview will be seen by American university\n                     students who are concerned about the conditions in which their clothing is made. Is\n                     there anything else about the impact of the garment industry on worker and public\n                     health that you think they should know about? The girls who work in our country, we can definitively say that because the products\n                     of these factories that they make are up to standard, they are being exported to Europe\n                     and so many other countries of the world. Now, These are sincere workers, there's no doubt about that. The people who are behind these huge profits, if a portion of that went into their\n                     health, environment, housing, if their overall entire standard of living could be\n                     improved by spending even a little, then this industry will definitely go far. The\n                     workers will be benefited, as will the owners, and the country. Do you think concerned clothing consumers can do anything to help in addressing these\n                     situations and public health crises? Yes, of course they can. - and this has happened in the past. Wasn't it America that imposed a restriction once? What do you call it, when they chose to no longer prioritize Bangladeshi imports, there was something about not giving subsidies, or taking them off a list of special treatment, Bangladesh is no longer on that list and - that could only happen from all the pressure that was put on them. Saying, if they didn't improve things, they would stop buying from them. And no special priority would be given. So like this, at different times in different situations if the consumers and international organizations pressurize the owners and buyers, then they will obviously be bound to contribute to the improvement of the lives of\u00a0the workers. \n                      \n                   Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

My name is Lily. How many members are there in your family? There are four. Who are these four? My daughter, my son, my husband and me. How far have you pursued education? Oh, I studied until class three [3rd grade, U.S]. Are you from Dhaka?\n                      \n                   Yes, I've been in Dhaka since I was young. Oh, where do you live? I live at...you've heard of Mohakhali Bokkhopoti staff quarters? I rent a place there. What does your husband do? My husband is in the field of construction. What is your salary? My salary...do I tell you my basic one? Yes. It's 4,284BDT ($51 USD) per month My daughter's studying science, and my son is in the third grade. That's a lot of\n                     expenses. We need to pool together as much as possible. We pool together as much as possible. But now see, if we get 10,000BDT ($120 USD)\n                     that would have been perfect, that would have been really nice. We do get facilities\n                     here (AWAJ). To top it all of its worse when we get sick... Like if we get sick, it so happens that I might not be able to come to work or go\n                     anywhere, so I'll go see a doctor outside. But Miss Nazma has given us these facilities\n                     where we see a doctor every Monday. And where is your factory? \u00a0It's Taniz Garments in Tejgaon. How come you go there? Well you see the amount my husband makes is not enough to sustain a family of four.\n                     There's so many expenses, house rent itself is 4,000BDT ($48 USD), there's also my\n                     kids, there tuitions take up over 5,000BDT ($60 USD). So even if my husband makes\n                     15,000BDT ($180 USD) It's because these scarcities, and these needs, and the poverty we live in is why\n                     I took up the job there 5 years ago. How do you travel? Public transit? No, takes up 35 minutes but the roads are too narrow, so .\u00a0\n                      \n                   On foot? Do you travel alone or in groups? Most of the girls don't live in the area, so they other transports to the factory. Whichever they find most convenient, but But we live away because we get electricity and water, but you get the security. So we live there. So, What takes up most of your salaries? . And what about your groceries? The grocery basically involves the basic rice, lentils, and if we get those monthly\n                     it'll take up about 4,000 BDT ($48 USD). : How long have you worked in the industry?\u00a0 All the factories I've worked in? \u00a0Yes. If you consider all the factories.. I've worked in the industry for ten years Where did you work before this? I worked at this other place.\u00a0My life was basically as a helper and an operator. And then I got married and stopped working. After that I took up this job in which I've been in for 5 or 5 and a half years. Which factory is better,\u00a0This one or the older one? The former factory was so long ago but considering it wasn't too bad, they had good\n                     facilities. By the 10th they would pay for the overtime. They didn't yell at us there. They don't yell at us here either, but there's a lot of pressure at work. Last year there were two of us working this job and now it's just me. What? Why?\n                      \n                   With the new year,\u00a0They start getting rid of people every Eid break. Whether it's Ramadan break or Qurbani Eid break. Now they don't even wait for the breaks, they do it anytime. \"I don't like you, so\n                     I don't want to keep you\" they say. They provide them with their dues And they are\n                     leaving. Like this we had 100 people in our production line including helper, operator,\n                     and now there's 49 of us who work the same line. You know? There's so much pressure, like we'd sit after lunch, and went to washroom\n                     once. It's a lot of pressure to take. But they say, if you want to keep your job this\n                     is how it has to be. Why did they start doing this? They get rid of people, like a lot of girls say they won't work anymore So they'll\n                     be like is arrogant, and disrespectful. But don't you have unions? Yes but they're not all on the same team. Some back up the bosses, others back up the staff members You know? So there's three different motivations at work. And it's difficult to unify them into having a single motivation. Like say I'll say one thing, you'll say another, and he'll say he has a good relationship with the bosses, and he can't betray them. Fine, and then maybe you'll say how you have a good relationship with the staff members so you get holidays and breaks whenever and all these facilities. So then would you want to associate with us? No. Then it ends up us who takes bears the brunt of it all.\u00a0It's those of us who have to deal with poverty. What is your everyday routine? My routine is , and then I cook the rice. Heat up the curry and other food, then I take a shower.\n                     I generally keep the food cooked at night. I tend to do the grocery shopping at night\n                     on the way home from work. When do you get home? By the time I get home, it's almost 8pm and when I take the time to grocery shop it's\n                     about 8 when I get home. Since going home takes up 35 minutes, and then grocery shopping\n                     takes up some time too. So by 10pm or 10:30pm I finish cooking, and checking up on\n                     my kids studying. Then by the time I'm done with cooking, they're done with studying.\n                     So we eat up, and then go off to bed. When do you start working at the factory?\u00a0\u00a0\n                      \n                   Work at the factory starts at 8, so say if I can get out early I benefit from it. We get the 500 BDT ($5 USD) attendance bonus, and it helps make up for 5 days of grocery shopping. So I go as early as possible, since I'm healthy, and not ill and capable of it,\u00a0Me being healthy there isn't even a question of being late, that's it really. I haven't been late once in the past 10 months. So consider you get hurt on the job, who takes the responsibility? Do the owners take\n                     that? Yes, as in we have doctors there. We have a doctor two nurses, then they treat us.\n                     And if they notice it's not something they can properly deal with, they give us a\n                     slip to miss work. They'll say \"Go and get yourself treated, if the buyers find out\n                     then there would be issues. So they let us miss work.\" Do they allow you maternity leaves? : Yes. Have you ever needed one? Yes, I got one while having my son. And is this a paid leave? Yes, yes we do get paid, they're fine on that front. Do the staffs treat you well? Well treatment....the fact that one person has to pick up the toll of two is a harassment\n                     in itself, Now at the time most people feel victimized by this. This is it. The production continues to run just fine, so staffs are also busy explaining.\u00a0With the bosses how even if they're getting rid of people, the production is still running smoothly. There's no gap in production, right? And see, \u00a0Staffs such the as PM (Production Manager), GM (General Manager), then there's the Foreign Incharge, there's also the supervisor. So it's generally their salaries that increase, whereas with us. They increase it by everyone's base salary, and if we speak up they tell us that \"it's\n                     the Government that has made the scale, based on which we are paying you. If you try\n                     to make his an issue. There's really no point in it. \u00a0 \u00a0\n                      \n                   How safe do you feel working there?\u00a0 Regarding safety, we're doing pretty well. I feel safe. We have toilets, and there's canteen for us to eat, In this way we're doing pretty well, the environment is pretty good. The issue is the pressure of having the brunt of the production on your back, and refusing to increase the salary. And nowadays with the women,\u00a0Say, I'm refusing to hear them out the Floor Incharge or the PM forces me to sign on some papers, and then if I ever cross them again, they'll call me over.\u00a0And fire us, and without any benefits as well. This has recently started. asking if we're lawyers or something.\u00a0They tell us if we want to work in the company this is what we have to do. This is what we're told by the staff every time we bring up what happen to these women. That's when they start saying these things again. And now we're the ones with lesser powers, And we have a lot of male workers too. But the staffs don\u2019t even say anything to do them. They get all the facilities they need or want. They can even wear shoes inside. They won't yell at them or even tell them off. They basically want the male workers under their thumbs. But regardless they've grown a lot stronger, some of them have even begun to resist\n                     the tyrannies. Before we would not even dare, but coming here (AWAJ) we've learned\n                     to speak up a lot more. That's what I wanted to ask you. Yes, coming here.. Coming to the AWAJ Foundation, we also get a lot of facilities like we get the doctors, meet various people, various programs. We didn't understand before, but coming here, and attending the training programs we've learned how because we work so hard we need to eat healthy food like vegetables and such to remain healthy. Then we don't need to miss work and have them yell at us. Then we'll feel good about ourselves as well. This is the training, I got here. For two years I've done this training here. Listening to them, by eating right, the vegetables and the right kind of fish even I've noticed the difference. I've even noticed that I don't need to skip as I don't get sick as much. Like this month I've gotten the Attendance\u00a0bonus, now if I had fallen sick then would I have been able to get that bonus? No I wouldn't. And this is it, these are all things I've learned from here But what about the fact that they're forcing people to sign papers? Is AWAJ doing\n                     something about that? We've been complaining to Nazma and Khadija (another incharge) about this, and now\n                     they're going to take action against that. We told them everything, and they let us\n                     know that they will do something about it. \n                      \n                   So what are things consumers should know about the clothes? The buyers (note: not necessarily consumers) should know that a worker with long years\n                     of experience like me, who has been working for 5 and a half years now, And this is what our company/factory is refusing to admit, that experienced\u00a0Should not be getting fired out of the blue. Now I need the buyers to know that getting us kicked out actually hinders the system, the quality of work also drops, right? These women who have worked here for 10 to 15 years - they've left because of the\n                     way the staff and the company treats these women. So if an experienced worker like\n                     me Will the person that comes after me be able to match my work? Will she be able\n                     to produce the same with limited experiences? Never. Do girls under 18 work at your factory? No, we don't have that, now women have to enter showing their school certificates.\n                     Since this is the law now. Girls have to have passed the 10th grade at least, So like\n                     these...there are also Helpers, quality incharge who have university degrees that\n                     work there. They don't get jobs anymore, what can they do? Then having no other way,\n                     they join the garments industries in the quality section. Basically, they do the work\n                     of inspecting the clothes, they check. They basically inspect.\n                      \n                   Another question would be, If you could work in any other field, what would it be? I think working in garments is good work, there's a lot of restriction, and all the\n                     pressure makes it hard, and the . But now only just because I want to work elsewhere\u00a0It won't just happen. Like what if I want to work as a government service person? Will they give me a job? No they won't. So I tell myself where I am, with this life, we're doing pretty well. If only they would see and tell them that if the experienced workers get kicked out,\n                     it hinders the production, causes problems once the experienced people leaves. If\n                     they would see these, say something then that would be great, incredible. So this\n                     is my request to all, and...yes this. Are you only member in your entire family to work in this industry? I had a paternal uncle, he's left the world now. But yes his wife works in the industry as well.\u00a0And no one else in my family works in this industry. They work in other places, you know? So this consumer thanks you for all the work you've put in,\u00a0And asks whether you are able to have savings?\u00a0 Account?\u00a0 Yes. I mean barely, , sometimes 300BDT, depending on how much we are able to make in the specific months. You've already answered so many questions that I specifically wanted to ask!\u00a0Like you've already explained whether you are paid enough in regards to the amount of work that you put in.\u00a0 Compared to the amount I work it's definitely not enough. Like I've told you, the\n                     operator that worked next to me used to earn 7,000BDT ($91 USD) now this person is\n                     gone and my salary is still very little despite the fact that even though she has\n                     been gone for a year. I: Are you paid according to your place in the production line? : They're not paying us at all based on that. : But is that how it's supposed to be. They used to do that before like they'd consider a line, give us a month, tell us\n                     how much we needed to produce then when he'd succeed So this should be enough, we'll be back... \n                      \n                   Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

What is the date for the 2019 Coming Out Monologues? Thank you for your interest in the 2019 production of The Coming Out Monologues. At this time, dates for the 2019-2020 College of the Arts Performance Season have not been published. The Coming Out Monologues at KSU are in honor of National Coming Out Day, which is on October 11th.

I am in the closet. Can I not be in the pictures on the KPA and LGBTQ Resource Center\n                                    social media pages? The LGBTQ Resource Center respects the privacy of our students and understands that not all students are comfortable being photographed. It is our practice to ask students to complete photographic release forms prior to taking pictures of students in the LGBTQ Resource Center. \u00a0Photos taken during campus-wide and/or public events do not require a photographic release; however, we do make our best effort to inform students if we are taking pictures. This allows students to decide for themselves if they want to be included in the photo. If a student has a concern about a particular image, please contact us at   and we will work to resolve the concern. I'm a bisexual guy, would it be a good idea to get on PREP to prevent HIV infection,\n                                    and is there financial assistance? The decision of whether or not to start a PrEP protocol is best discussed between\n                                          you and your medical provider. For basic information on PrEP, the Center for Disease\n                                          Control and Prevention offers the following resource:  If you would like to make an appointment with KSU\u2019s Student Health Services to speak with a medical provider about PrEP, please visit   or call 470-578-6644 to request an appointment. How long has the LGBT Resource Center existed at KSU? The LGBTQ Resource Center (called the GLBTIQ Resource Center at the time) opened in January 2013 and was located in room 164 of the Carmichael Student Center on the Kennesaw Campus. We are now located in suite 253.\u00a0 How long has Kennesaw Pride Alliance existed? What exactly are \"campus allies\"?

Registration for Atlanta Pride will open after the start of the Fall Semester in August.\n                                          We will be sure to share links to registration forms via email, our website, Owl Life,\n                                          and social media. We look forward to seeing you at Pride! Any advice/suggestions for a very closeted kid that wants to go to Pride for the first\n                                    time in Atlanta without getting caught? With an average of 250,000 people attending Atlanta Pride over the course of the weekend,\n                                          Atlanta Pride can be an incredible experience to be a part of. KSU supports students\n                                          who wish to go by providing transportation and participating as a university in the\n                                          Pride Parade. In the past, students have had similar concerns and an option they took\n                                          advantage of was to remain on the bus during the parade. This provided them privacy\n                                          while also allowing them to experience what it is like to walk in the Atlanta Pride\n                                          Parade. The Atlanta Pride Parade is televised, filmed, and photographed with photographers\n                                          and camera crews along and within the parade route. Ultimately, it is up to each individual\n                                          student to decide with what they are most comfortable. The staff of the LGBTQ Resource Center are happy to meet with students who have questions\n                                          or concerns about Atlanta Pride and work to find solutions that will work for each\n                                          student.

The Marietta Campus already has a resource center available to students, the UNITY\n                                          Center! The UNITY Center, located on the Marietta Campus, provides diversity services\n                                          and programs for students; including LGBTQ, women, international, and multicultural\n                                          identities. The UNITY Center focuses on the intersections of identity and works to\n                                          facilitate dialogue within and between various student groups on the Marietta Campus.\n                                          The UNITY Center is located in the Student Affairs Suite of the Wilson Student Center,\n                                          room 230F. Additionally, students who are primarily based on the Marietta Campus are invited\n                                          and encouraged to visit the LGBTQ Resource Center on the Kennesaw Campus as well as\n                                          participate in all LGBTQ-related programs hosted on the Marietta Campus. If I change my preferred name at KSU, will the University send mail addressed to my\n                                    preferred or legal name? I am closeted and living with family; I don't want to risk\n                                    being outed. Yes, any mail received from KSU would reflect the preferred name on file. Once a preferred\n                                          name change is requested and approved, your preferred name will override your given/legal\n                                          name in most software systems used on campus. While there are exceptions to which\n                                          systems will make use of preferred names, most campus communication will only refer\n                                          to your preferred name. There is not an option for you to limit or select which systems\n                                          will use preferred or legal/given name. For a complete list of which systems use preferred name and which systems use legal/given\n                                          names, please visit  Would you know of any resources for LGBTQ staff members, such as committees, events,\n                                    listserves, etc.? If I'm at GHC on the Marietta Campus, am I allowed to be a part of the community there? I always see different statistics for how many people are LGBTQIA+, what percentage\n                                    of millennials identify as such? First, in order to begin to answer your question, we must first define who a Millennial\n                                          is. According to Pew Research Center, a millennial is someone who was born between\n                                          the years of 1981 and 1996 (Dimock, 2018). With a common understanding of who qualifies\n                                          as a Millennial established, we can begin to explore what data is available to answer\n                                          your question. In a 2017 survey conducted by Harris Poll, on behalf of GLAAD, 20% of Millennial respondents\n                                          identified as being LGBTQ, whereas 12% of all respondents in the survey identified\n                                          as LGBTQ. Of the 20% of Millennials who identified as LGBTQ, 8% identified themselves\n                                          as being cis-gender and 12% identified themselves as being non-cisgender. It is important\n                                          to note that the sample size for this study was just over 2,000 participants (GLAAD,\n                                          2017, p. 3). In a 2016 survey conducted by Gallup, they found that 4.1% of the overall U.S. population\n                                          identifies as LGBT and 7.3% of Millennials in the survey identified as LGBT (compared\n                                          to 5.8% in 2012). This survey included over 1.6 million respondents (Gates, 2017). If we narrow the focus and look only at college students, we find that 9.7% of respondents to the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) identified outside of being straight or heterosexual. Additionally, 1% of respondents in this study identified their gender as not being \u2018Man\u2019 or \u2018Woman.\u2019 It is important to note that the NSSE survey was conducted across 722 four-year colleges and universities in the US (650) and Canada (72) in 2017 and is administered to first-year and senior students at participating institutions (National Study of Student Engagement, 2017, pp. 6-7). If we want to narrow it further and only look at KSU, the 2014 Campus Climate Assessment\n                                          Project for the Kennesaw Campus provides us with some data. In this survey, there\n                                          were 3,573 students who participated in the survey (Rankin & Associates Consulting,\n                                          2014, p. 13). Of the students who participated, 0.64% identified as transgender or\n                                          genderqueer and just over 19% of students identified as themselves as being non-heterosexual\n                                          (Rankin & Associates Consulting, 2014, p. 196). This gives us a total percentage of\n                                          19.64% of Kennesaw Campus students identifying as LGBTQ. The same survey was distributed\n                                          to the Marietta Campus in 2015. That survey had 712 student respondents, of which\n                                          1.4% identified as genderqueer and 15.5% identified their sexuality as non-heterosexual\n                                          (Rankin & Associates Consulting, 2015, pp. 14, 148). This gives us a total percentage\n                                          of 16.9% of students on the Marietta Campus identifying as LGBTQ. Bibliography Dimock, M. (2018, March 1).

I'm gay and really want to surround myself with a queer-positive community.\u00a0 The LGBTQ Resource Center realizes the transition to college can be both exciting\n                                          and challenging. Being engaged with the campus community is an important part of a\n                                          well-rounded college experience.

The LGBTQ Resource Center is a great place for students to learn more about LGBTQ\n                                          communities and to connect with other students who may identify within the spectrum\n                                          of LGBTQ communities and identities. The LGBTQ Resource Center is a public space accessible\n                                          to all students, staff, and faculty at KSU. Because it is a public space expectations\n                                          of privacy cannot be enforced or guaranteed between students; however, privacy is\n                                          expected and respected among all staff in the LGBTQ Resource Center. The LGBTQ Resource Center does not collect or store information on how a student may\n                                          identify along the spectrum of LGBTQ identities. If students choose to share this\n                                          information with our staff, we do not share it with others unless the student has\n                                          given us permission to do so. Our staff respects the privacy of all students and maintains\n                                          this privacy whenever possible.

We recognize that LGBTQ students often face a unique and challenging road on the journey to graduation and extra time should be taken to acknowledge the hard work and determination put forth by graduating LGBTQ students to reach this momentous occasion. Rainbow Graduation provides an opportunity to honor and celebrate graduating LGBTQ and Ally students for their accomplishments, efforts, and contributions while in attendance at Kennesaw State University. \u00a0 \u00a0 In 1995, Ronni Sanlo, the Director of the University of Michigan\u2019s LGBT Resource Center, decided that LGBT students need their own graduation ceremony on campus to honor their accomplishments and contributions to the university, and to acknowledge the fact that they had survived the many challenges faced by LGBT students. Since then, Lavender Graduation ceremonies have been hosted at dozens of universities across the country. Rainbow Graduation provides an opportunity to not only acknowledge graduating students\n                     but to also recognize members of the KSU community who have made positive contributions\n                     to the LGBTQ community on campus.

However, we are here to direct you to appropriate resources and assist by hosting Tax Workshops for international students (yes, even international students need to file taxes, regarding of whether you have worked or not)!\u00a0 Please see below for more information regarding taxes in the US. Who Needs to File Taxes? Even if you did not earn any income, if you were physically in the US on F or J status anytime between 1 January \u2013 31 December 2020, you're obligated to file a Form 8843 with the IRS (the Internal Revenue Service, or \u2018IRS\u2019, are the US tax authorities). Meanwhile, if you earned more than $0 of taxable US source income, you may need to\n                                       file a federal tax return with the IRS. Depending on your individual circumstances,\n                                       you may also need to file a state tax return(s). What is the Tax Filing Deadline? Who is considered Resident or Nonresident for Federal Tax Purposes? How do I file? We have teamed up with Sprintax to provide you with an easy-to-use tax preparation\n                                       software designed for nonresident students and scholars in the US. We (and all other\n                                       university staff) are not qualified or allowed to provide individual tax advice. After you login to Sprintax, you will be asked a series of questions about the time\n                                       you have spent in the US over recent years. Sprintax will then determine your tax\n                                       status. If it determines that you are a \"nonresident alien\" (NRA) for federal tax\n                                       purposes, you can continue to use the software to respond to a series of guided questions.\n                                       Sprintax will then complete and generate the tax forms you need to send to the tax\n                                       authorities. However, if Sprintax determines that you are a resident alien for federal tax purposes,\n                                       you won't be able to continue using the software. \u2714 Passport \u2714\u00a0Visa/Immigration information, including form I-20 (F status) or form DS-2019 (J status) \u2714\u00a0Social Security or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (if you have one) \u2714 W-2 (It is issued by the end of January for the previous year.

If you did earn US Income: Sprintax will generate your \"tax return documents\", including\n                                       either a 1040NR-EZ or a longer form 1040NR, depending on your circumstances. \u00a0 After you finish your federal return, Sprintax will inform you if you need to complete a state tax return. If so, you will have the option to use Sprintax for an additional\u00a0fee. However, it is your choice to use them or to do the state tax return on your own. \u00a0 Remember to read the instructions that Sprintax provides. You will be required to download, print and sign your federal tax return and mail\n                                       it to the IRS. If you have a state filing requirement, you must also mail this to\n                                       the tax authorities. Finally, if you only need to file Form 8843, this will also need to be mailed to the\n                                       IRS. When are Tax Workshops? Need Sprintax Support?

I met my\n                                          best friends here. GV has helped me reach out to other members of the global community\n                                          which now makes me more of a global leader. International students including myself\n                                          have come and gone through GV and ISA whenever we have had a problem because they\n                                          had the answers.

I was asked to be more active with the FSA, ISA (International Student Association) and the GV (Global Village) at Kennesaw State University. I was welcomed into a family where race, ethnicity, culture and being international was celebrated. I even have met people of mixed heritages and cultures like myself. Gerald de Jesus \n                                     This place has allowed me to expand my horizons when it came to diversity. I feel\n                                          more accepted here. Giuseppe De Fazio \n                                     Home, simply. I am here at KSU because of the GV. I made deep relationships with people here. I was supposed to transfer but this became my home. The Global Village is why I\u2019m still here. Albaraa Alarjan \n                                     This place is a safe haven for internationals. You can interact with people from all walks of life.

The esports program\n                     allocated a portion of its budget - $35,000.00 - to financial aid for its varsity\n                     players and awarded selected players their scholarships in the middle of Fall 2020.\n                     It was then discovered in Spring 2021 that the funding source of the esports program\n                     budget is not allowed to be used for financial aid. The esports program has been working\n                     since Spring 2021 to obtain a funding source that is allowed to supply financial aid\n                     to our varsity players and meet or exceed the offerings of our inaugaral year. As\n                     the program works to obtain a funding source that meets these two requirements, updates\n                     will be shared in the   and on  . Three reasons for the decision to decrease the number of our varsity titles are: the esports program\u2019s scholarship situation and long-term sustainability. Recruitment is a topic the esports program has begun to address as of Summer 2021.\n                     With 2020 being our first year, we were fortunate to have lots of talent already present\n                     at our university. The esports program has a lot of growth to do before reaching the\n                     levels of recruitment of well-renowned esports programs. Making sure there will be\n                     a steady stream of new and talented players within our state is something we felt\n                     we could make possible by researching what titles Georgia high school esports programs\n                     are competing in. Our research led us to conclude that SMITE is not of those titles\n                     and in turn will not be sustainable as a varsity title once current players from our\n                     university move on. We will still be supporting SMITE as one of our   offerings.

Prior to the official program, the Esports Club at KSU existed as a means to connect gaming students interested in all levels of play, from the casual to the competitive. In the fall of 2019, a small task force was created out of the growing interest in and impact of esports activity at KSU. This committee consisted of representatives from a wide variety of stakeholders, including KSU Athletics, the Division of Student Affairs, the College of Computing and Software Engineering, and most importantly, current KSU students. Through the work of this committee, KSU was able to launch its first-ever, university-sponsored esports tournament in March 2020, named Game On, KSU. Based on the success of this program and a vision for the future of esports at KSU, former President Pamela Whitten laid the groundwork for the creation of the formal program we see today.\u00a0 The Esports Program at Kennesaw State University provides a holistic esports experience for all students, regardless of skill level, through intercollegiate competition, campus-based events, dedicated space and resources, and support programs. By our efforts, we hope to create an esports experience at KSU that is accessible, enjoyable, and developmental for every KSU student who engages in this program.\u00a0 Accessibility - esports should be an activity that any student can participate in, regardless of skill level, personal equipment, physical disability, or any other barrier to play.\u00a0 Diversity - esports activities are more enjoyable and successful when multiple voices and perspectives are heard and valued.\u00a0 Integrity - engaging in esports activities should be characterized by all parties abiding by a common set of ethics and values, including fair play, respect, and honesty.\u00a0 Wellness - participation in any university activity should not come at the cost of ones total wellness (physical, mental, emotional), and esports is no different.\u00a0 Excellence - esports teams should strive to be the best representatives of KSU both in and out of game.\u00a0 Program Coordinator for Esports Norman graduated in May 2020 from KSU at the age of 20 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. Having collected all the credits needed to graduate high school in the 11th grade, he started out as a dual-enrolled freshman at KSU during his senior year of high school in 2016.\u00a0 Throughout his undergraduate career, he was very involved with the KSU Esports Club and the esports scene. His involvement ranged from serving as an officer in the club for 3 years, specifically president for 2 years, to playing on competitive teams that represented the university, to playing on teams in the amateur League of Legends scene.\u00a0 In addition to having experience as a player, he worked as a contracted coach for\n                     the Esports Performance Academy (EPA). EPA focuses on holistic player development\n                     and works with individuals, teams, high schools, and universities to bridge the gap\n                     to professional play. Now, while pursuing his Masters in Computer Science, Norman brings all of these experiences\n                     to his position as Esports Program Coordinator at KSU and works alongside upper administration\n                     and other staff at KSU to better the esports experience for all students. \u00a0\u00a0 \"Let's make KSU a major player in the collegiate esports space.\" - Norman Reid \u00a0 This position supports the work of the Esports Program at Kennesaw State University. Students in this position will work on projects for the Esports Program which range from staffing at events, collaborative work with other departments at KSU, creating marketing materials, managing social media, and much more.\u00a0 Contact Info 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) Resources For Related Links Follow KSU  (470-578-4636)  2023 Kennesaw State University.

The esports program at KSU is taking measures to ensure the university will solidify itself as a major player in this space. From collegiate competition to everyday student involvement, this article will highlight the various outlets the esports program at KSU will be using to provide an S+ esports experience to students. Let\u2019s get into it. Collegiate competition starts very soon. Titles such as League of Legends and Rocket\n                     League will have tons of action during the Fall semester. The developers of League\n                     of Legends, Riot Games, will be hosting a Fall Invitational where schools can send\n                     1 team to compete from their respective conferences. Similarly, the Collegiate Rocket\n                     League (CRL) will be hosting a Fall season where schools can send 1 team to compete\n                     from their respective conferences. Registration for LoL Fall Invitational ends   and the registration for the CRL Fall season ends  . \u00a0In addition to these events, other leagues such as the Collegiate Star League (CSL) and the American Video Game League (AVGL) will be hosting events with no restriction on how many teams a school can field. Some of these events even ensure that players will be matched versus others of a similar skill level! So, how do you get involved? This is were the Varsity Program and the Competition Clubs under the esports program at KSU step in. The varsity program under the esports program at KSU wants to ensure that the best\n                     players the university has to offer will represent KSU at intercollegiate competitions.\n                     To this end, a lot of preparation is taking place before official tryouts will be\n                     announced and taking place.  .

There are many other titles aside from League of Legends and Rocket League that have\n                     Competition Clubs.

They are a means of bringing student concerns to the attention of the faculty\n                     and institutional authorities and of formulating opinions on various issues on the\n                     campus and in the world at large. In response to the editorial responsibility of students,\n                     the University must provide sufficient editorial freedom and sufficient financial\n                     autonomy for the student media to maintain their integrity of purpose as vehicles\n                     for free inquiry and free expression in an academic community. KSU Student Media are designated public forums. Student editors and managers have\n                     the authority to make all content decisions without censorship or advance approval. Institutional authorities, in consultation with students and faculty, have a responsibility\n                     to provide written clarification of the role of student media/publications, the standards\n                     to be used in their evaluation, and the limitations on external control of their operation.\n                     At the same time, the editorial freedom of student editors and managers entail corollary\n                     responsibilities to be governed by the canons of responsible journalism, such as avoidance\n                     of libel, indecency, undocumented allegations, attacks on personal integrity, and\n                     the techniques of harassment and innuendo. As safeguards for the editorial freedom\n                     of student media, the following provisions are necessary: A. The student press should be free of censorship and advance approval of copy, and\n                     its editors and managers should be free to develop their own editorial policies and\n                     news coverage. B. Editors and managers of student media should be protected from arbitrary suspension\n                     and removal because of student, faculty, administrative or public disapproval of editorial\n                     policy or content. Only for proper and stated causes should editors and managers be\n                     subject to removal and then by orderly and prescribed procedures. The agency responsible\n                     for the appointment of editors should be the agency responsible for their removal. C. All college published, broadcast and financed student media should explicitly state\n                     on the editorial page and broadcasts that opinions expressed are not necessarily those\n                     of Kennesaw State University or the student body.

In 2002, this system-wide\n                     initiative was created in response to the lower rates of black male college enrollment\n                     and completion across the state of Georgia. These lower completion rates were attributed,\n                     in part, to the lack of curricular and co-curricular support that black men received\n                     prior to and throughout their college journeys. In response, the USG funded the AAMI\n                     grant program which has led to system institutions establishing campus initiatives\n                     that have been very successful in improving black male college success and completion.

User Guides and Workshops User Guides for Campus Community User Guides for Division of Student Affairs Workshops Glossary of Terms Glossary Search Branches allow various departments, divisions, or areas of university life to operate\n                                       independently within the system, running processes like the event submission processes\n                                       and organization registration separately. Admin branches can also be overseen by different\n                                       administrative users, allowing staff on campus to independently control various features\n                                       within the site. The Division of Student Affairs currently operates two Branches within the Owl Life\n                                       System: Students can use Owl Life to generate a record of their involvement to document experiences\n                                       gained outside the classroom. This document is called the Co-Curricular Transcript,\n                                       and can be used when applying for grad school, provide speaking points for job interviews,\n                                       to showcase your students' leadership experience, etc. When creating events, you have the option to allow students to include their participation\n                                       on their Co-Curricular Transcript. Students have the ability to remove experiences\n                                       from their CCT. A community administrator is defined as any user who has access to the\u00a0Admin\u00a0view when opening up the Owl Life Switchboard.\u00a0Community administrative tools allow you to manage users and organizations in your community, export reports, and oversee your community\u2019s involvement. Community admins are also able to see and manage sensitive information about each user in the community.\u00a0 There are two types of community administrators in Owl Life.\u00a0All-Access\u00a0Community Administrators\u00a0have access to every tool in the\u00a0Admin\u00a0view and are also able to manage every administrative branch and organization in the community.\u00a0Limited Community Administrators\u00a0have access to the\u00a0Admin\u00a0view in the Switchboard but may not see every tool. For example, a limited community admin may only be able to manage one specific dropdown menu, such as users or paths, in the community\u00a0Admin\u00a0view. The\u00a0Events\u00a0tool allows you to manage your organization's events from one central location. Within the Division of Student Affairs, the Events tool is used to track interactions and experiences between students and DSA Departments, Offices, and Units. Operating within this context, the Events tool is used to capture student attendance\n                                       at traditional event experiences (e.g. guest speakers, programs on the campus Green,\n                                       and workshops) and student visits to our various departments and centers throughout\n                                       the Division (such as Center Check-Ins or Office Visits). Ultimately, our goal is\n                                       to capture as many of the interactions we have with students within the Owl Life system\n                                       as possible. Event categories act as tags that allow us to classify and filter events in ways that\n                                       are relevant to our campus community. Events can be tagged with multiple categories. Event categories also provide additional options for administrators, such as the ability\n                                       to create \"hidden\" categories that can be used as administrative-use-only tags for\n                                       events. Many campuses will use hidden event categories to support their Co-Curricular\n                                       Paths or will tag events according to report data they may want to pull at the end\n                                       of the semester or the end of the year. Within Division of Student Affairs, all Departments/Offices have specific Admin Event\n                                       Categories that apply to Programs and Check-In Events, as well as DSA level Event\n                                       Categories. Creating a paperless office or organization is simple in Owl Life - take all your forms online using the Form builder. The Forms tool can be used for a variety of purposes and the easy-to-use tools in Owl Life make it easy to move many of your current paper-based processes into your site.\u00a0Owl Life offers you convenient methods to host forms with personalized access, logic and reviewer options. Please see Managers have access to edit and alter settings of organization pages. These users do not manage any administrative functionality but have control over the content and rosters of their organization pages. Organization managers can be assigned \"All Access\" or \"Limited Access\" to granularly define which tools are able to be accessed within the organization\u2019s page. Membership refers to users who have \u201cjoined\u201d an organizations Owl Life page. Within the context of DSA Departments and Offices, memberships should be understood as users who are \u201cfollowing\u201d a Department or Office. Users who have joined a DSA Department\u2019s page have easier access to that Department\u2019s Owl Life page from the Owl Life homepage. Additionally, Owl Life page managers are able to send messages to their members. Users can join an organization in one of two ways: Owl Life\u00a0uses Message Relays or simply Relays to allow you to send a rich-text email message to many people based on their involvement data in Owl Life. Managers with \"All Access\" to the Messaging function have the ability to message the\n                                       members of their organization. From this area messages can be composed and delivered\n                                       to various combinations of organization members and officers. There are two criteria\n                                       that student leaders can use to define the message recipients: By using these criteria, a Manager can send a message to those holding certain\u00a0[positions]\u00a0and/or these specific\u00a0[members]. For example, all Student Assistants within a Department or Office. The News tool\u00a0allows you to keep your members up-to-date on all of your latest news. With a format similar to a blog, members can view a quick summary of the most recent news or drill down to view the full contents of each post. To view News in your organization, navigate to your organization's public page and scroll until you see News posts listed. Organization Types allow us to classify our organizations/departments based on how\n                                       we want them to behave within the system. Organization types allow for more administrative\n                                       control, including the ability to add restrictions to tools, assign specific position\n                                       templates, or customize the re-registration process. Co-Curricular Paths guide students through a flexible series of events, organization\n                                       involvement, and experiences towards meaningful achievements we design. Paths can\n                                       vary in scale from very brief and simple to far more complex with nuanced scaffolding. Position Templates give administrators a consistent way to manage who holds various positions within the organizations they oversee. Position Templates represent roles like President, Captain, Advisor, Student Assistant, Coordinator, Assistant Director, or Director. The Positions feature also allows for\u00a0streamlined and efficient messaging\u00a0based on the Position a user holds. You can also\u00a0assign different position templates to different Organization Types within the system. Owl Life provides the Division of Student Affairs access to a rich array of reports\n                                       about student engagement, departmental programming, and student demographic data.\n                                       Access to reports varies based on the Community Access permissions a DSA employee\n                                       has been granted. To access Owl Life system reporting, a user must have at least a\n                                       Limited Community Access level. Access to Student-Level/User data is restricted to\n                                       those with Full Community Access. Please access the .PDF below\u00a0for a full list of available reports (accessible by request) from within the Owl Life System. The Roster tool allows you to manage your organization\u2019s membership with ease and efficiency. Within the Roster tool, you have access to: Depending on the type of organization you manage, you may have the ability to\u00a0track service hours that you would like to associate with your department/unit. These service hours can be included on the co-curricular involvement record of students, allowing them to showcase their involvement in an organization or in the community.\u00a0 This function is not connected to the VKSU system or the Student Leadership and Service\n                                       department. Owl Life has the ability to capture student attendance via a Blackboard Card Reader that is able to pull data from a student\u2019s KSU ID Card via an RFID chip. Blackboard card readers must be formatted prior to use in order to properly pull information from the KSU ID Card.

On May 10, 1930, on the campus of Howard University, in Washington DC, the National\n                     Pan-Hellenic Council was formed as a permanent organization with the stated purpose\n                     and mission: Early in 1937, the organization was incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois and became known as \u201cThe National Pan-Hellenic Council, Incorporated.\u201d Kennesaw State University is home to six (6) of the nine (9) organizations that fall\n                     under the governance of the National Pan-Hellenic Council. The chapters value academic\n                     excellence, community service, and strong sisterhood/brotherhood connections.  Chapters Executive Board Membership Intake Each Fall and Spring Semester, the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) hosts NPHC Convocation. At this event, students are able to meet and socialize with members of the Divine Nine. Each Chapter presents about their organization's history and values. This is also an opportunity to learn about the membership intake process and requirements to join an organization.\u00a0 Attendance is required for any potential new member interested in participating in\n                                       the membership intake process. Policies and Standards \u00a0 What is NPHC? The National Pan-Hellenic Council, Inc. (NPHC) is the umbrella organization for the nine (9) historically African-African American fraternities and sororities. It was organized in May 1930 at Howard University in Washington D. C. The stated purpose of the organization as written in 1930 is, \u201cUnanimity of thought and action, as far as possible, in the conduct of Greek letter collegiate fraternities and sororities, and to consider problems of mutual interest to its member organizations.\u201d Membership in NPHC organizations extends beyond the college experience. Upon initiation,\n                                       individuals accept a lifetime commitment to the goals and objectives of their respective\n                                       organizations. Members develop many close bonds and friendships that are often unbreakable\n                                       and maintained throughout their lives. Which NPHC organizations are active, and recognized by the Department of Fraternity\n                                 and Sorority Life at Kennesaw State University? Why should I join NPHC? How do I become a member of an NPHC organization? Recruitment and membership intake for the organizations of the National Pan-Hellenic\n                                       Council may vary differently between each of the Divine Nine organizations. Those\n                                       who are interested in learning more about these Divine Nine Fraternities and Sororities\n                                       are encouraged to research the history of each organization, visit their National\n                                       website, learn of their respective membership requirements, and develop a relationship\n                                       with the chapter members of your organizational interest. To any extent beyond that,\n                                       membership recruitment and intake is under full coordination of the specific chapter\n                                       and their national organization. However, all membership intake processes must be\n                                       conducted by a chapter that is both active with its national organization and recognized\n                                       by the Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life at Kennesaw State University. All students interested in joining a NPHC chapter at KSU, must attend NPHC Convocation.\n                                       Convocation is hosted every semester by the Dept. of Fraternity and Sorority Life\n                                       and the National Pan-Hellenic Council. More information for registering for Convocation,\n                                       dates, and cost of attendance can be found on  \u00a0and the KSU NPHC Instagram page, @ksunphc. How much does it cost? What are the requirements to become a member? The requirements vary from organizations to organization. Kennesaw State University\n                                       requires students to have a least a 2.5 GPA, but some organizations requirements are\n                                       higher than those. Students interested in joining an NPHC organization must complete\n                                       12 credit hours prior to joining, but some organizations may have other credit requirements. It also helps to have prior leadership experience, and community service, as most\n                                       organizations will want to see your resume to know that you will represent their organization\n                                       well. It is also recommended that you attend the organizations programs and service\n                                       projects to get to know them better, to increase the likelihood that they will select\n                                       you for membership. If I am a legacy member, meaning my parents or close family members were a member\n                                 of NPHC, am I automatically in? Do I have to be African-American to join? How do I express interest in joining an NPHC organization? Does NPHC step? Some NPHC organizations do step and stroll, however stepping and strolling is a small\n                                       portion of what we do, and should not be a major consideration when considering joining\n                                       an organization.

The end of the twentieth century gave birth to a new movement \u2013 that of multiculturalism. Newly formed fraternities and sororities were looking to write a new page in the Greek-letter society history books. The message that they announced was the inclusiveness of all cultures, races, religions, and creeds.

Expansion also allows for the\n                                       advancement of a widely growing movement of culturally-based organizations nationally\n                                       to positively impact our community at KSU.

We can only see improvements if we speak out and take action against injustice. Where is my money going? When can I move in and are my meals for the week provided?\u00a0 What do I need to be successful in Recruitment? 1. Be yourself! You want to join an organization that loves you for who you are, not\n                                       what you are trying to be 2. Keep an open mind! You may go into recruitment thinking you know what chapter you want to join, but be open for that to change. Remember you have only seen a little bit of our organization, so treat each day as a new opportunity to find out more.\u00a0 3.This is your experience! It does not matter what your friends or family is telling you, do what makes you happy. If you were in a buffet line behind your friend and they put your least favorite food on their plate, would you do the same? Would you judge them for liking that food? No everyone has their own preferences.\u00a0 What is a Pi Chi? What if I don't get along with my Pi Chi? Will there be any new initiatives this Recruitment to engage me in this process? Will I have the opportunity to meet all of the organizations? What should I talk about during Panhellenic recruitment events? How do I get a good understanding of the chapter if I don't interact with everyone? How will sororities invite me back if I've only talked a few people? What if I have trouble choosing a sorority? What are the requirements for membership? What is a bid? What if I\u2019m not happy with the bid I receive?\u00a0 If I go through Panhellenic recruitment, am I obligated to join? Is there a minimum GPA requirement to receive a bid? In order to be a part of our community, potential members must have a minimum 2.5 GPA. \u00a0This number is based off of an individual\u2019s most recent cumulative GPA, whether that is their high school GPA, transfer GPA, or Kennesaw State GPA. \u00a0It is important to note that the Department bases our GPA calculation in conjunction with Kennesaw State University, meaning for high school and transfer GPAs that only core, non-elective classes are counted. \u00a0For the Kennesaw GPA, the department utilizes the adjusted cumulative GPA for membership purposes. Additionally, while the above listed GPAs are the minimum requirements to receive an invitation of membership into an organization, having this GPA does not guarantee membership. \u00a0For many of our organizations, a new member must have a GPA that is at least equivalent to their organization\u2019s average GPA that is listed under the \u201cAbout Us \u2013 Academics\u201d section of the FSL website. \u00a0Due to this number constantly changing, other than publishing the minimum GPA for each council, the Department is unable to confirm the actual GPA needed to receive an invitation for membership into an individual organization. What if my parents/guardians do not approve of me joining? What are expectations of membership? When a student is extended an invitation to join a Sorority they become a new member.\n                                       This is a period of learning about fraternity and sorority life prior to initiation.\n                                       New Member Education Program is designed to teach the fundamentals of being an effective\n                                       member of your sorority, so that the chapter can enjoy the future leadership of these\n                                       members. The objectives of an effective New Member Education Program are: To assist and develop members to be outstanding members\u00a0 To develop members intellectually, spiritually, and socially/morally To familiarize new members with the Sorority - the organization and the people To demonstrate friendship and provide a conduit to build strong, lasting friendships To prepare new members to uphold the standards and ideals of your Sorority, and strive\n                                       to continually improve it What are some things I will need to do as a New Member?

It was founded on April 10, 1856 as the Theta Chi Society, at Norwich University, Norwich, Vermont, U.S., and was the 21st of the 71 North-American Interfraternity Conference men's fraternities. Theta Chi Fraternity was founded on April 10, 1856, at Norwich University in Norwich,\n                     Vermont, by two military cadets, Frederick Norman Freeman and Arthur Chase. A third\n                     man, Egbert Phelps, is considered to be the \"assistant founder\" for lending his help\n                     and advice to Freeman and Chase although he was never an undergraduate member himself\n                     (he was a member of the Chi Psi Fraternity). The first initiates after the founders\n                     were Edward Bancroft Williston, Frederick Howard Farrar, Ridge Hudson, and Lorenzo\n                     Potter. The early history of Theta Chi Fraternity is closely connected with the history\n                     of Norwich University. In 1866 a massive fire devastated the university, completely destroying the Old South\n                     Barracks. This disaster prompted the university to move from Norwich, Vermont to its\n                     present location in Northfield, Vermont. During fall quarter in 1881, Norwich University\n                     was reduced to only 15 students and Theta Chi membership was reduced to one undergraduate\n                     member, James M. Holland. In November of that year, Phil S. Randall and Henry Hersey\n                     approached Holland and insisted that they be allowed to join Theta Chi; Holland agreed,\n                     thus saving the Fraternity from extinction. The Fraternity was incorporated in Vermont in 1888, and acquired its first chapter\n                     house two years later. However, it remained a single entity for forty-six years until\n                     the Beta Chapter was installed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1902. A\n                     Grand Chapter was organized in 1908 to direct the fraternity and promote its growth.\n                     In 1942, Beta Kappa Fraternity joined Theta Chi Fraternity, bringing 16 undergraduate\n                     chapters and over 6,000 undergraduate and alumnus members into the ranks. The Foundation\n                     Chapter was established in 1953 as a charity to provide educational scholarships and\n                     assistance. In 1965, the Zeta Gamma Chapter was installed at the University of Alberta\n                     in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, making Theta Chi an international fraternity. Initially, the Alpha Chapter and Grand Chapter volunteered to maintain all records\n                     of the Fraternity until 1923, when the first Executive Office was established in New\n                     York City. In 1928, the headquarters was moved toHuntington, West Virginia. In 1932,\n                     the headquarters moved again, this time to Trenton, New Jersey. Since 1990, Theta\n                     Chi Fraternity's international headquarters have been located at 3330 Founders Rd,\n                     Indianapolis, Indiana.

The Xi-Chi Chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon at Kennesaw State\n                     University was installed as a chapter on February 24, 1973, and is the oldest continuously\n                     active chapter on the campus. The TKE Mission is to aid men in their mental, moral, and social development for life\n                     and enable them to create lifelong relationships that enhance educational, interpersonal,\n                     community and professional success. The TKE Educational Foundation offers over $75,000\n                     in scholarships to collegiate Tekes each year. Since our founding in 1899, Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity has never had an exclusionary\n                     clause to prevent individuals from joining. Our Founders established a Fraternity\n                     in which the primary requisites for membership would be the personal worth and character\n                     of the individual rather than the wealth he possessed, the honors or titles he could\n                     display, or the rank he maintained on the social ladder. The primary philanthropy of Tau Kappa Epsilon is St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital. St. Jude is leading the way the world understands, treats and defeats childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food. Treatments invented at St. Jude have helped push the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20 percent to more than 80 percent since its opening. We won\u2019t stop until no child dies from cancer. In 2019, Tau Kappa Epsilon pledged to donate $10 million in 10 years and in 2021, TKE became the first fraternity to raise over $1 million for St. Jude in a single year. We believe that college is the most opportune time for developing one\u2019s abilities and to allow one the opportunity to grow as a man. Tau Kappa Epsilon aims every day to build Better Men for a Better World.

The friendships formed during your undergraduate years are relationships that will last far beyond graduation. \u00a0Delta Chi was founded on the principle of bringing together men of similar interests to work towards a common good. This doesn\u2019t mean that men in a particular chapter are just clones of one another, but rather that the common bond of personal development through brotherhood can motivate a group of men to accomplish great things. This close association of college and university men produces life-long friends. Character is good sportsmanship. Character is academic success and integrity. Character\n                     is holding yourself and others to a higher standard. Character is doing the right\n                     thing. The character of a man is the greatest measure of his potential. In Delta Chi,\n                     character is a core value and the cornerstone of the Fraternity. Originally founded as a law fraternity, Delta Chi still holds as its cardinal principle:\n                     the perpetuation of justice in society. A Delta Chi is always concerned with doing\n                     the right thing, even when it might not be the popular thing to do. This is an everyday\n                     value that all men should practice and a value that, as a member of Delta Chi, you\n                     will be expected to live. The reason you chose to go to college was to get an education. Delta Chi helps you make that happen. \u00a0The Educational Foundation provides members with scholarship opportunities based on academic success and campus involvement.

Our Principles are Unity, Love, and Respect. It was founded in 1975 by 17 Founding Mothers at Kean University in New Jersey. \u00a0Traditionally, the role of the Latina woman was that of maintaining the family institution and falling into the realm of the Machismo stigma. As the Latino migration to the United States increased, so did the emergence of independent Latina women, eager to be at the forefront of an era of a new educational, political and social consciousness. In the early 70's, colleges and universities experienced an influx of Latino enrollment. With this growth, the need for support groups and outreach programs were at an all-time high, primarily for the low percentage of Latina women in higher education institutions.In 1975, Kean University in Union, New Jersey introduced and began to implement bilingual studies, as well as a Latino and Caribbean studies department. Women of Latin descent were now able to embark in Higher Education even if English was not their native language. \u00a0It was at this university, in this historical time period, that a group of women convened to discuss the formation of a sorority for Latina women. Its focus would be to actively integrate itself into the social, political and community service arena that other students had been involved with. Lambda Theta Alpha was recognized at Kean University as the First Latina Sorority\n                     founded in the United States. This organization was the first to recognize the need\n                     for a support system, thus creating one. The desire to progress, dedication to their\n                     community, and the aspiration for the advancement of the Latina women marked the beginning\n                     of Lambda Theta Alpha. It allowed the independent Latina woman of a new era to have\n                     a sense of belonging and with that, achieve her highest potential. It would define\n                     a new role for the Latina woman, one with education, goals and vision in hopes of\n                     great success.
